### Simple Way To Web Scrape Articles

The pip plugin `newspaper3k` makes it simple to extract articles and their information. This includes their published date, author, and obviously the article text itself. [towardsdatascience.com](https://towardsdatascience.com/scraping-a-website-with-4-lines-using-python-200d5c858bb1) offers a nice tutorial on how to use it.

This could be useful for downloading and categorizing articles though a way to automatically query article downloads & automatically gather article links would have to be devised. Content could then be pushed into the text analyzer.
