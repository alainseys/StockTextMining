3 Things You'll Want to Know When DraftKings Announces Earnings,Motley Fool,3 days ago,"Fortunately, the NBA, MLB, and NFL all resumed their seasons after the months-long hiatus. When DraftKings reports its earnings on Nov. 13, shareholders will ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/09/3-things-youll-want-to-know-when-draftkings-announ/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","The coronavirus pandemic caused many sports leagues to pause their seasons for months beginning in March. Since DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) relies on its customers to make wagers on the outcome of sporting events, the lack of sports hurt the company significantly.

Fortunately, the NBA, MLB, and NFL all resumed their seasons after the months-long hiatus. When DraftKings reports its earnings on Nov. 13, shareholders will find out if there was pent-up demand to engage in wagering on sporting events.

Regaining momentum as sports leagues restarted

Investors will first want to look at the company's overall revenue growth. In the most recent quarter, it was 25%, which is quite impressive given how much the coronavirus pandemic plagued sports leagues. Assuming no major sports cancellations, the company expects to grow revenue by 30% at the midpoint for the second half of fiscal 2020. The NBA and MLB were already able to complete their seasons and crown the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Dodgers, respectively, as champions. Still, with coronavirus cases surging to record highs in the U.S., it remains to be seen if the NFL and other major sports can do the same.

Next, those interested in the stock will want to know more about gambling legalization and its increasing availability in various states. According to DraftKings, as of Sept. 1, its Sportsbook app and website are available in Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The company's standalone casino app is also live in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The more states that legalize, the larger the total addressable market becomes for DraftKings. It is also important to note that state budgets have become strained by the pandemic. Legalizing online sports betting is one way states can fill budget gaps without relying on the federal government to pass a stimulus bill.

Finally, shareholders should look at the company's reported monthly unique player (MUP) base and growth. This figure is especially important for the company's daily fantasy sports segment. The more players who enter an event, the larger the prize pool, which then attracts even more players to enter. This positive virtuous cycle is one reason the figure is so important to shareholders. During the six months ended June 30, the company had 507,628 MUPs, which was down from 537,142 from a year ago. The suspension of major sports leagues during the period probably had a say in that drop.

What it could mean for investors

Wall Street's average expectation is for DraftKings to report revenue of $132 million and a net loss per share of $0.61. The company also stated that it expects to report revenue of $132 million at the midpoint when it updated the prospectus for an additional stock offering on Oct 6. The figure would be an increase of 97% from the prior year.

DraftKings is continuing on its path as a high-flying growth stock, but the risk remains that major sports leagues will pause their seasons, setting the company back again. However, it does have over $1.2 billion of cash and no debt on the balance sheet to weather that storm if it needs to.",draftkings,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.794, 'pos': 0.206, 'compound': 0.0772}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.0,0.0386,0.0,0.012866666666666667,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral

The volatility is likely to ...,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/08/3-things-to-watch-in-the-stock-market-this-week/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Stocks soared last week as the U.S. presidential election moved closer to a conclusion. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) and the S&P 500 index (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) gained over 7% over the five trading days. The Dow is now roughly flat for the year, while the S&P is up 9%.

A few widely followed companies will announce earnings results over the next few trading days, including Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), and DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG). Below we'll take a look at the key trends that might send the stocks for these three companies moving this week.

1. Beyond Meat's competitive outlook

Investors are optimistic heading into Beyond Meat's Monday earnings report. The plant-based meat substitute maker announced strong sales growth in the early days of the pandemic, revealing in August that second-quarter revenue jumped 69% year over year as sales to retailers offset plunging demand from restaurant chains.

Since then its growth prospects have remained impressive. Beyond Meat recently announced expanded distribution of its core products through Walmart, for one. It also added Beyond-branded sausage links to its portfolio, which joined plant-based sausage patties and meatballs as popular 2020 launches.

Those actions have investors predicting continued strong sales growth through the rest of the year. But Beyond Meat will also have to contend with extra competition from traditional meat producers like Tyson Foods and retailers like Kroger as it seeks to maintain its early lead in this attractive food niche.

2. McDonald's operating margin

Investors already know that McDonald's will have some good operating news to announce on Monday. The fast-food titan said in a mid-quarter update that it returned to sales growth in the core U.S. market in recent weeks following a 9% year-over-year decline in fiscal Q2.

But this week's report will add important context to that revenue figure, including the breakdown between customer traffic, which fell, and average order spending, which is surging.

Meanwhile, Starbucks said in late October that profitability fell due to the shift in demand toward delivery services and the aggressive use of promotions aimed at keeping customers engaged with the brand even as they stay closer to home. McDonald's will likely announce some similar margin pressures as it looks ahead to a potential full-growth rebound in late 2020 or early 2021.

3. DraftKings' demand trends

Investors have endured a roller-coaster ride with DraftKings' stock heading into Friday's earnings report. The volatility is likely to continue for this unproven consumer discretionary stock.

Besides the share price surge through most of the year, major investor concerns include a surprising decline in viewership for sporting events in recent months and the potential for further event pauses due to COVID-19 outbreaks. And DraftKings' business would be heavily impacted by a recession, should one take hold in the U.S. market.

Executives won't have much clarity to offer about the wider economic environment on Friday, but look for CEO Jason Robins and his team to explain how they see sports viewing demand, and growing market access, impacting the business into early 2021. Management should also update investors on their plans for using the cash they raised from a recent stock offering as part of DraftKings' big-picture strategy to build a profitable sports-betting business.",draftkings,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.429, 'neu': 0.571, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.128}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.429, 'neu': 0.571, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.128}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",-0.042666666666666665,0.0,-0.042666666666666665,-0.028444444444444442,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral
3 Hot IPO Stocks to Buy in November (And 1 Still to Come),Motley Fool,5 days ago,"DraftKings: Online gambling's biggest name.

And when you include companies going public through special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC), there are dozens of exciting new businesses to invest in this year.

Sifting through the IPOs that have taken place and the ones still expected this year, four companies emerged as exciting growth stocks for investors: Asana (NYSE:ASAN), Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG), and Airbnb.

1. Asana: Managing work tasks more easily

Asana is the modern workflow-management tool that's built for a mobile world. It allows teams to assign tasks, manage approvals, and even make sure assignment forms are filled out before going on to the next person. If you've ever tried to manage a disparate team of workers, you know how valuable a tool like this can be, and Asana makes it easy.

Like many companies going public, Asana isn't yet profitable. It reported a $41.1 million net loss for the second fiscal quarter of 2021 on $52 million of revenue. And management expects a loss of $40 million to $42 million in the fiscal third quarter. But the financial opportunity for Asana is much longer term.

If Asana can engrain itself as a valuable tool, it'll be a staple for businesses around the world. That'll allow the company to charge higher prices as it adds more features, and eventually generate a profit. I like how simple Asana's tools are, and for companies looking to get more efficient, it's a great tool to use. And an easy-to-use product is great to get behind after an IPO.

2. Snowflake: Data in the cloud

The cloud-data company Snowflake has been one of the hottest IPOs of 2020, more than doubling on its first day on the market. The excitement isn't without merit, either. The company's sales increased 133% in the first half of 2020, the customer base has doubled over the past year, and there are more than 500 million queries daily on the company's platform.

The $72 billion market cap is lofty, considering Snowflake's $500 million revenue run-rate, but this is a stock that's all about long-term growth. Management thinks the cloud-data platform could be an $81 billion market opportunity, and it's just starting to be adopted.

Like lots of IPOs, Snowflake is highly valued and therefore highly risky. But it has big backers in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and a booming cloud business, so now is a great time to jump into this hot IPO.

3. DraftKings: Online gambling's biggest name

Online gambling is another business that's just starting to gain steam, and DraftKings could be one of the best bets in the industry. The company went public earlier this year through a SPAC and hasn't looked back.

In a theme that's becoming common for IPOs, DraftKings is losing money as it waits for the online gambling business to expand. But as online gambling expands beyond a handful of states where its legal and generating significant revenue, this could be a multibillion-dollar business.

I'm a big believer that online gambling will be commonplace a decade from now. And as a leader in the industry, DraftKings has the opportunity to capitalize on the growth. For IPO investors, this is a bet worth making.

4. Airbnb: Upending travel as we know it

Finally, let's end this roundup with a company that's expected to IPO and may do so in November. Airbnb has arguably done more than any other company in recent years to change the way we travel, opening up opportunities to rent out rooms and homes around the world. And the network of users and suppliers it has built is ultimately its long-term value.

Like all travel companies, Airbnb has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. And that led to a disappointing fundraising round in the spring, which valued the company at $18 billion. But long term, this is still a business with great opportunities to disrupt travel.

As we return to a more normal travel and vacation cadence, I think Airbnb's revenue will rebound and 2020 will be seen as an aberration. If it goes public anywhere near its latest funding round, it could be a steal for investors. This is one IPO I'm hoping to jump on before 2020 is over.

IPOs can be a risk worth taking

Not all IPOs are worth investing in, but buying into disruptive companies early on can be a great way to invest in multibaggers. These are my top IPOs from 2020, and I think all four have the potential to be long-term winners for investors.",draftkings,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.725, 'pos': 0.275, 'compound': 0.8225}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.725, 'pos': 0.275, 'compound': 0.8225}]",0.27416666666666667,0.0,0.27416666666666667,0.1827777777777778,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Positive,Neutral,Somewhat Positive

Andrew Harry Rubenstein -- Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Accel's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. As everyone is aware, after 3.5-month shutdown, video gaming relaunched on July 1. The Accel team rose to the challenge and worked with our location partners to reopen as many locations as possible. As a result of these efforts, I'm pleased to report this quarter was the highest revenue and adjusted EBITDA quarter in Accel's history. Later in the call, I will provide an update with respect to pandemic developments, but I would first like to review some other highlights from the quarter. In July, we redeemed the pace public warrants, and in August, we completed an exchange offer of all remaining warrants. As a result, less than 0.03% of the warrants remain outstanding today.

This redemption and exchange offer simplified our capital structure and reduced the potential dilutive impact of the warrants. In early September, we entered into an exclusive agreement with DraftKings to promote their content and programming across all our marketing channels, including our in locations, digital display screens. This first of its kind collaboration further differentiates our offering and deepens our player relationships. This partnership will help us retain and extend agreements with existing locations, attract new organic and competitor locations and most importantly, drive additional players to our locations.

While we are still evaluating the benefits of this partnership, initial results have been positive. Finally, in late September, we completed an underwritten public offering of 9.1 million shares. The offering raised approximately $90 million, which we expect to deploy in the next nine months. Our M&A pipeline remains active, and we aim to continue executing on our growth strategy. For the third quarter, we recorded $136 million in revenue and $23 million in adjusted EBITDA. Our balance sheet remains strong with net debt of approximately $140 million and total liquidity of $274 million. Accel is extremely well positioned to capitalize on any opportunities that may arise in the coming months.

With that, I'm going to turn it over to Brian Carroll, our CFO, to walk you through the third quarter results in more detail.

Brian M. Carroll -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Andy. As of September 30, we had 11,597 VGTs in 2,363 locations. Year-over-year increases of 12% and 3%, respectively. The increase in locations demonstrates that while we are operating in a new normal environment, Accel continues to grow. The IGB has resumed their meetings, and our sales teams continue to sign new organic and competitor locations. In addition, our attrition rate on closures remains in line with the pre-COVID historical average.

At the end of September, our average residual contract length was approximately 6.9 years on a stand-alone basis and also 6.9 years, including the Grand River acquisition. As a reminder, the Grand River locations originally had an average residual contract length of 5.8 years. The closing of this gap demonstrates our ability to successfully integrate the locations and extend their agreements. We have installed more than 806 VGTs and expect to install a total of 1,000 by year-end. Originally, we expect to be able to update 50% of our VGTs remotely to the higher bet limit software and 50% via an on-site update.

During the remote update process, it was determined approximately 25% of the remotely updatable VGTs will now require an on-site update. It's important to note this issue affected the entire industry, not just Accel. Today, approximately 50% of all VGTs have been updated to the higher-bet limit software. We continue to perform on-site updates every day, but based on current software availability, we now expect to complete the update by June of next year. We had total revenue for the third quarter of $136 million, the highest revenue quarter in Accel's history. Our combined third quarter location hold-per-day was $596, a year-over-year increase of 4%.

It's important to remember Grand River was acquired on September 16, 2019, meaning those locations were included for all Q3 2020, but only 15 days of Q3 2019. Excluding the Grand River acquisition, our location hold-per-day was $649, a year-over-year increase of 11%. Adjusted EBITDA was $23 million, another record for Accel. As a reminder, the Illinois VGT tax increased from 33% to 34% on July 1. capex was $13.5 million cash spend in the third quarter compared to $9.3 million in the third quarter of 2019. The increase was largely attributed to vendors that allowed us to defer payments during the second quarter. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $140 million in net debt and $274 million of liquidity, consisting of $179 million of cash on our balance sheet and $95 million of revolver availability. Back to you, Andy.

Andrew Harry Rubenstein -- Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Thank you, Brian. I'd now like to discuss the COVID-19 situation in Illinois. As of July 1, in connection with the relaunch, VGTs are required to be spaced 6-feet apart or to be separated by partitions. Players must wear mask in the gaming area and PPE is provided to the players. These precautions have ensured VGTs can be played safely. Returning player response has been positive as demonstrated by our revenue. In July, Governor Pritzker divided Illinois into 11 regions. As of November 4, all regions were operating with mitigation measures, which include a prohibition on indoor dining. VGTs are available for play from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.

Despite the reduced hours, Accel has only seen a minimal impact to net video gaming revenue, but continues to monitor the situation closely. Our October revenue will be published by the IGB in the coming weeks, which will reveal Accel had another positive month. To wrap things up I'm extremely pleased with our record third quarter performance, demonstrating the resiliency of Accel and our industry. The Accel team members continue to overcome the current challenges while delivering industry-leading customer service. We will now take your questions.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Greg Gibas. Your line is open.

Greg Gibas -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst

Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. And congrats on the record results. Good to see. I was just wondering if you could give a sense of how much of your operating expenses in the quarter were maybe onetime in nature just kind of due to getting all your locations up and running again with the new protocol and dividers?

Brian M. Carroll -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes, this is Brian. The capex was approximately over $2 million that was spent on dividers. With regard to onetime operating expenses, we -- they're included in our numbers. The only time we've adjusted EBITDA for COVID was related to primarily if we have -- when we furloughed employees and paying benefits and retention bonuses and so forth like that. So -- but the -- just to give you an idea on a monthly basis right now, COVID's probably costing us a little over $100,000 a month in operating.

Greg Gibas -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst

Got it. Okay. Thanks for clearing that up. I appreciate that. And regarding the VGTs that have been updated with the new software for the higher betting limits. Have you noticed an incremental uplift, I guess, in revenues from those machines, even though, I think you said it was only 50% or so of an updated so far?

Andrew Harry Rubenstein -- Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Yes. I mean, it's provided a lift in our overall revenue per location. So whether it's from more selection or more opportunity for people to play, we can't really discern what specific driver, but it does -- it has helped us raise the overall location revenue.

Greg Gibas -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay. Great. I guess, last one for me. Just considering we saw those three strong months in the quarter across the states. I guess I was wondering if you could comment on anything or share anything in relation to how gaming activity has trended in October relative to those previous months? And then maybe how you expect the IGBs decision to kind of limit hours of play, how you think that will affect Q4?

Andrew Harry Rubenstein -- Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

October was a very positive month. And the actual number should be published in the next 10 to 12 days. But we have seen some effect, although, it's minimal from the limitation of the hours. But it's really early to make any definitive assessment.

Greg Gibas -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst

Sure, OK. Thank you.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Ketelhut of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.

Bill Ketelhut -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Hi, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what you're hearing from your -- from the locations that you work with? And whether any recent restrictions are going to lead to maybe incremental financial distress or more churn?

Andrew Harry Rubenstein -- Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

I would tell you that if I own a restaurant bar and I can't sell food or beverage in doors and then the temperatures 20 degrees outside, it's going to impact me. So there is going to be some impact on their business. We've seen a little of that when we had a little cold stretch in the last couple of weeks. The question is like what is -- how long the mitigations last? And how they become -- and how they're eased? Yesterday, the governor indicated that he was going to evaluate things in the next couple of weeks. So we'll hope -- we're hopeful that they'll allow some indoor consumption. And once even some occurs, I think the overall effect will be really minimal.

Bill Ketelhut -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

That's helpful. Thank you. And I guess, kind of more on related note. There seems to be a kind of a lot of moving parts to free cash flow, given the acquisition of Tom's Amusements. And I know you're buying terminals kind of on a forward basis. Could you just give us a sense on what free cash flow conversion as a percentage of EBITDA should be like on a normalized environment, maybe ex all those growth investments?

Brian M. Carroll -- Chief Financial Officer

I can give you this, right. I can give you some ranges. Say, for example, on our current, what you've seen in Q3, probably free cash flow is about approximately around $6 million. You then have to deduct capex, but keep in mind, most of our capex is for growth purposes. To refresh maintenance capex runs us maybe $2 million to $3 million in a given year. So with that in mind, you have your -- what you've seen in Q3, you have this approximately $6 million a month of free cash flow, less however we spend for growth capex, purchasing equipment, and that could be about, I'd say, on average, about $2 million to $2.5 million per month.

Bill Ketelhut -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Got it, thank you. And I guess, one last one, I'll sneak in here, if I can. Is there anything that you've kind of learned as you spent more time in Georgia over the last quarter?

Andrew Harry Rubenstein -- Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

I'd say the major lesson learned there is that we're going to have to be very prudent in choosing our business partners as there's a wide range of companies and operations, and some of them are more attractive to partner with and especially as a public company, we need to protect our brand and the ethics that we run our business. And there's individuals there that don't seem to be concerned about running the business with integrity.

Bill Ketelhut -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Great, thank you. That's it from me.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Steve Pizzella of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.

Steve Pizzella -- Deutsche BankQ -- Analyst

Hey, guys thanks for taking my question. Can you just talk about any insights that you might have to the type of customers you're seeing at your locations relative to the pre-pandemic visitation? We have heard from some of the regional gaming operators that they have been seeing a younger customer. I just wanted to see if that aligns with what you were seeing also?

Andrew Harry Rubenstein -- Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

I wouldn't say it's necessarily a younger customer. We're seeing some younger players. And there are, obviously, some older players that are less comfortable going out. But you got to remember, like our portfolio is so diversified geographically throughout the state that the kind of feelings or reaction to the COVID restrictions are very different depending on where you live. And so we're not seeing any major trend. But there is some individuals that -- who are elderly, they don't feel comfortable. And then for some of the younger individuals who may have gone to a casino where -- or gone to the movies or done some other activity, those players have trended toward us. And we're getting more of that visitation.

Steve Pizzella -- Deutsche BankQ -- Analyst

Okay. Great, thanks. And then can you -- just wanted to follow-up on the DraftKings deal. Can you just kind of talk us through the benefit that you received from it and any economics you could actually share from it?

Andrew Harry Rubenstein -- Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

So there's been -- as far as benefits, we've seen a few of our competitor locations decide that they wanted to move their business over to Accel when their contracts have finished because we're offering a benefit that's unique in this marketplace. So we've seen that. We're going to get some new customers. People also are opening up new establishments that want to have that feature for their guests. Financially, we, today, don't have a revenue share as we don't have a license for sports betting.

But we are an affiliate and are receiving compensation from DraftKings as we're getting a lot of sign-ups from players and that benefits being shared with the establishments that the player signs up at. So -- or they acknowledge that they kind of got the information. So it's very early to measure that. But we have got a fairly significant amount of sign-ups since we kicked this off. And DraftKings is, I would guess doing well in the state of Illinois in terms of player acquisition and player communication. And we were a form of that communication.

Steve Pizzella -- Deutsche BankQ -- Analyst

Okay, great. Appreciate it. Thanks guys.

Your next question comes from the line of John DeCree of Union Gaming. Your line is open.

John DeCree -- Union Gaming -- Analyst

Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Andy, I I guess the first one is for you, perhaps. And then a follow-up maybe for Brian. And I'm not sure if you've added any more color. But with the equity raise in the quarter and adding some cash to the balance sheet. I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned about possibly deploying that over the next nine months or so. And I was wondering if you could give us any kind of more color guidelines as to where you'd be looking or prefer to spend that capital, would it be more likely in Illinois? Or something like you did with Tom's, perhaps in Georgia or another state, just kind of getting your sense of capital priorities?

Andrew Harry Rubenstein -- Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

There's lots of opportunities. There's still some significant things that we're working on in Illinois. And as we have the focus to explore into new markets and really establish ourselves. Those opportunities are also presenting themselves. So I think you'll see us move in a couple of different directions. And hopefully, 2021 will be pretty acquisitive year.

John DeCree -- Union Gaming -- Analyst

Thanks Andy, that's helpful. And Brian, perhaps for you. With additional liquidity on the balance sheet, your leverage ratio comes down quite a bit, and I think kind of anticipating some growth capital being deployed in 2021, as Andy had just discussed, where do you feel the right kind of leverage ratio is for Accel kind of right now kind of with growth capital to deployed and lift out and kind of is there a range that you guys feel comfortable with and want to be in?

Brian M. Carroll -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes, John. I mean more recently, just because of a little bit of disruptions, we were as high as around 4. And typically, we might get -- obviously, we're delevering back historically, we've always been comfort around the two to three range, and then we would lever up if we did an acquisition and then kind of fall back down pretty quickly just because of our free cash flow. And -- but right now, like I said, we're below 4. And so it's kind of a -- historically, since we've been in business, we've done it that way. So typically, once everything levels off, we feel pretty comfort around two to 3. Did I answer your question?

John DeCree -- Union Gaming -- Analyst

It does. That's perfect. Thanks, guys.

There are no further questions over the phone lines at this time. I call -- I turn the call back over to Andy Rubenstein.

Just wanted to thank everyone for listening today. Hopefully, the mitigation from our governor will be modified and reduced in the coming weeks. And for all of you that live in Illinois and around the country, please continue to wear your masks because they will only help our industry as well as to mitigate the effects of the COVID environment. Have a good day. Thank you.

Even those consumers who aren't afraid of gathering in a large crowd may still be leery of splurging.

There are some entertainment names, however, that are not only surviving in this challenging economic environment, but thriving in it. Others are positioning smartly for the recovery that should take shape once the COVID-19 pandemic is finally over.

Sony (NYSE:SNE), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) are among those names worth considering right now as stock investments. Let's find out a bit more about these three entertainment stocks.

1. Sony

You may see Sony as the long-time maker of tape recorders, television sets, and camcorders, but Sony is so much more than that these days. In fact, consumer electronics only make up about a fourth of the company's revenue. Another fourth comes from its video gaming business centered around PlayStation consoles. Cameras, movie production, and music publishing each make up around 12% of Sony's top line, while its financial services arm drives roughly 16% of its sales.

This revenue diversity has not only allowed Sony to smooth out erratic sales and earnings, but it also gives the company opportunities to focus on what's working well.

The real game-changer as we head out of 2020 and into 2021, however, is a reinvigorated gaming industry.

Ratings agency Nielsen reported earlier this year that at the peak of lockdowns, 82% of the world's consumers were playing video games of some sort. Even as recently as August, U.S. consumer spending on video games and hardware was up 37% year over year, according to market research firm NPD Group. And the company specifically noted that its subscription-based video game service had seen decided growth in recent months. With the launch of Sony's next-generation PlayStation 5 console slated for later this month, the company should see strong demand from now-hooked gamers who may be on the hunt for something newer and better. Sony says it's aiming to outsell the PlayStation 4 in its first year of launch, which saw the purchase of 7.6 million units. That's huge.

The clincher: The version of the PlayStation 5 that doesn't come with a disc drive not only costs $100 less than the disc-drive version that will retail for $499, but it will also steer consumers toward Sony's online menu of game downloads. Those digital downloads generally mean higher margins on game sales.

2. Comcast

Most investors think Comcast is primarily a cable television company, and as such, a name to steer clear of. Cord-cutting is killing the business segment. That line of thinking is flawed, though.

Yes, Comcast is the owner of cable brand Xfinity, which lost another 273,000 customers last quarter. That brings the two-year attrition tally to nearly 2 million people who've canceled their Xfinity cable service.

But cable is only a fraction of Comcast's business, and the company is adding subscribers to a much more important and much more profitable offering. Last quarter's $5.4 billion worth of cable revenue only accounted for 22% of the company's top line, and during the same quarter, it added 633,000 new high-speed internet customers. It's added over 3 million broadband subscribers in just the past couple of years, and the internet-customer relationship is one that can be leveraged in a lot of ways, like offering wireless phone service or ad-supported streaming TV.

Yes, Comcast continues to hurt in other ways. It's also the owner of NBCUniversal, which is a TV and film presence. NBC is on the wrong side of the cord-cutting movement, and theaters have been shut down for the better part of the year.

Comcast is adapting on those fronts too, however. Its ad-supported streaming platform, Peacock, now boasts 22 million viewers since its public debut in mid-July, and while it's not yet the new norm, Universal has found respectable success in bypassing theaters and selling new films directly to consumers.

Comcast can survive a shrinking cable TV market.

3. Caesars Entertainment

Finally, add Caesars Entertainment to your list of entertainment stocks to buy.

It's suffered its fair share of problems in 2020. Just when it looked like the company might be able to shrug of the impact and drama related to its 2015 bankruptcy and subsequent restructuring, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the casino and resort industry in a hurry. The United States gambling business contracted 79% during the second quarter of the year, according to the American Gaming Association.

The company is using the slow time to maneuver for what the world may look like once the pandemic is in the rearview mirror. In September, it confirmed a $3.7 billion bid for U.K.-based bookmaker William Hill (OTC:WIMHY), and just a couple of weeks before that, it entered into a joint venture with Walt Disney's ESPN and DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG). Both deals put Caesars Entertainment in a better position to plug into a fragmented but fast-growing sports betting and online gambling market that could be worth $150 billion per year.

To this end, three more U.S. states legalized sports betting with last week's election, bringing the total to 25.

Since DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) relies on its customers to make wagers on the outcome of sporting events, the lack of sports hurt the company significantly.

Fortunately, the NBA, MLB, and NFL all resumed their seasons after the months-long hiatus. When DraftKings reports its earnings on Nov. 13, shareholders will find out if there was pent-up demand to engage in wagering on sporting events.

Regaining momentum as sports leagues restarted

Investors will first want to look at the company's overall revenue growth. In the most recent quarter, it was 25%, which is quite impressive given how much the coronavirus pandemic plagued sports leagues. Assuming no major sports cancellations, the company expects to grow revenue by 30% at the midpoint for the second half of fiscal 2020. The NBA and MLB were already able to complete their seasons and crown the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Dodgers, respectively, as champions. Still, with coronavirus cases surging to record highs in the U.S., it remains to be seen if the NFL and other major sports can do the same.

Next, those interested in the stock will want to know more about gambling legalization and its increasing availability in various states. According to DraftKings, as of Sept. 1, its Sportsbook app and website are available in Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The company's standalone casino app is also live in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The more states that legalize, the larger the total addressable market becomes for DraftKings. It is also important to note that state budgets have become strained by the pandemic. Legalizing online sports betting is one way states can fill budget gaps without relying on the federal government to pass a stimulus bill.

Finally, shareholders should look at the company's reported monthly unique player (MUP) base and growth. This figure is especially important for the company's daily fantasy sports segment. The more players who enter an event, the larger the prize pool, which then attracts even more players to enter. This positive virtuous cycle is one reason the figure is so important to shareholders. During the six months ended June 30, the company had 507,628 MUPs, which was down from 537,142 from a year ago. The suspension of major sports leagues during the period probably had a say in that drop.

What it could mean for investors

Wall Street's average expectation is for DraftKings to report revenue of $132 million and a net loss per share of $0.61. The company also stated that it expects to report revenue of $132 million at the midpoint when it updated the prospectus for an additional stock offering on Oct 6. The figure would be an increase of 97% from the prior year.

DraftKings is continuing on its path as a high-flying growth stock, but the risk remains that major sports leagues will pause their seasons, setting the company back again. However, it does have over $1.2 billion of cash and no debt on the balance sheet to weather that storm if it needs to.",draftkings,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.794, 'pos': 0.206, 'compound': 0.0772}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.0,0.0386,0.0,0.012866666666666667,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral

Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) and the S&P 500 index (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) gained over 7% over the five trading days. The Dow is now roughly flat for the year, while the S&P is up 9%.

A few widely followed companies will announce earnings results over the next few trading days, including Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), and DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG). Below we'll take a look at the key trends that might send the stocks for these three companies moving this week.

1. Beyond Meat's competitive outlook

Investors are optimistic heading into Beyond Meat's Monday earnings report. The plant-based meat substitute maker announced strong sales growth in the early days of the pandemic, revealing in August that second-quarter revenue jumped 69% year over year as sales to retailers offset plunging demand from restaurant chains.

Since then its growth prospects have remained impressive. Beyond Meat recently announced expanded distribution of its core products through Walmart, for one. It also added Beyond-branded sausage links to its portfolio, which joined plant-based sausage patties and meatballs as popular 2020 launches.

Those actions have investors predicting continued strong sales growth through the rest of the year. But Beyond Meat will also have to contend with extra competition from traditional meat producers like Tyson Foods and retailers like Kroger as it seeks to maintain its early lead in this attractive food niche.

2. McDonald's operating margin

Investors already know that McDonald's will have some good operating news to announce on Monday. The fast-food titan said in a mid-quarter update that it returned to sales growth in the core U.S. market in recent weeks following a 9% year-over-year decline in fiscal Q2.

But this week's report will add important context to that revenue figure, including the breakdown between customer traffic, which fell, and average order spending, which is surging.

Meanwhile, Starbucks said in late October that profitability fell due to the shift in demand toward delivery services and the aggressive use of promotions aimed at keeping customers engaged with the brand even as they stay closer to home. McDonald's will likely announce some similar margin pressures as it looks ahead to a potential full-growth rebound in late 2020 or early 2021.

3. DraftKings' demand trends

Investors have endured a roller-coaster ride with DraftKings' stock heading into Friday's earnings report. The volatility is likely to continue for this unproven consumer discretionary stock.

Besides the share price surge through most of the year, major investor concerns include a surprising decline in viewership for sporting events in recent months and the potential for further event pauses due to COVID-19 outbreaks. And DraftKings' business would be heavily impacted by a recession, should one take hold in the U.S. market.

Executives won't have much clarity to offer about the wider economic environment on Friday, but look for CEO Jason Robins and his team to explain how they see sports viewing demand, and growing market access, impacting the business into early 2021. Management should also update investors on their plans for using the cash they raised from a recent stock offering as part of DraftKings' big-picture strategy to build a profitable sports-betting business.",draftkings,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.429, 'neu': 0.571, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.128}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.429, 'neu': 0.571, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.128}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",-0.042666666666666665,0.0,-0.042666666666666665,-0.028444444444444442,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral

Andrew Harry Rubenstein -- Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Accel's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. As everyone is aware, after 3.5-month shutdown, video gaming relaunched on July 1. The Accel team rose to the challenge and worked with our location partners to reopen as many locations as possible. As a result of these efforts, I'm pleased to report this quarter was the highest revenue and adjusted EBITDA quarter in Accel's history. Later in the call, I will provide an update with respect to pandemic developments, but I would first like to review some other highlights from the quarter. In July, we redeemed the pace public warrants, and in August, we completed an exchange offer of all remaining warrants. As a result, less than 0.03% of the warrants remain outstanding today.

This redemption and exchange offer simplified our capital structure and reduced the potential dilutive impact of the warrants. In early September, we entered into an exclusive agreement with DraftKings to promote their content and programming across all our marketing channels, including our in locations, digital display screens. This first of its kind collaboration further differentiates our offering and deepens our player relationships. This partnership will help us retain and extend agreements with existing locations, attract new organic and competitor locations and most importantly, drive additional players to our locations.

While we are still evaluating the benefits of this partnership, initial results have been positive. Finally, in late September, we completed an underwritten public offering of 9.1 million shares. The offering raised approximately $90 million, which we expect to deploy in the next nine months. Our M&A pipeline remains active, and we aim to continue executing on our growth strategy. For the third quarter, we recorded $136 million in revenue and $23 million in adjusted EBITDA. Our balance sheet remains strong with net debt of approximately $140 million and total liquidity of $274 million. Accel is extremely well positioned to capitalize on any opportunities that may arise in the coming months.

With that, I'm going to turn it over to Brian Carroll, our CFO, to walk you through the third quarter results in more detail.

Brian M. Carroll -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Andy. As of September 30, we had 11,597 VGTs in 2,363 locations. Year-over-year increases of 12% and 3%, respectively. The increase in locations demonstrates that while we are operating in a new normal environment, Accel continues to grow. The IGB has resumed their meetings, and our sales teams continue to sign new organic and competitor locations. In addition, our attrition rate on closures remains in line with the pre-COVID historical average.

At the end of September, our average residual contract length was approximately 6.9 years on a stand-alone basis and also 6.9 years, including the Grand River acquisition. As a reminder, the Grand River locations originally had an average residual contract length of 5.8 years. The closing of this gap demonstrates our ability to successfully integrate the locations and extend their agreements. We have installed more than 806 VGTs and expect to install a total of 1,000 by year-end. Originally, we expect to be able to update 50% of our VGTs remotely to the higher bet limit software and 50% via an on-site update.

During the remote update process, it was determined approximately 25% of the remotely updatable VGTs will now require an on-site update. It's important to note this issue affected the entire industry, not just Accel. Today, approximately 50% of all VGTs have been updated to the higher-bet limit software. We continue to perform on-site updates every day, but based on current software availability, we now expect to complete the update by June of next year. We had total revenue for the third quarter of $136 million, the highest revenue quarter in Accel's history. Our combined third quarter location hold-per-day was $596, a year-over-year increase of 4%.

It's important to remember Grand River was acquired on September 16, 2019, meaning those locations were included for all Q3 2020, but only 15 days of Q3 2019. Excluding the Grand River acquisition, our location hold-per-day was $649, a year-over-year increase of 11%. Adjusted EBITDA was $23 million, another record for Accel. As a reminder, the Illinois VGT tax increased from 33% to 34% on July 1. capex was $13.5 million cash spend in the third quarter compared to $9.3 million in the third quarter of 2019. The increase was largely attributed to vendors that allowed us to defer payments during the second quarter. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $140 million in net debt and $274 million of liquidity, consisting of $179 million of cash on our balance sheet and $95 million of revolver availability. Back to you, Andy.

Andrew Harry Rubenstein -- Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Thank you, Brian. I'd now like to discuss the COVID-19 situation in Illinois. As of July 1, in connection with the relaunch, VGTs are required to be spaced 6-feet apart or to be separated by partitions. Players must wear mask in the gaming area and PPE is provided to the players. These precautions have ensured VGTs can be played safely. Returning player response has been positive as demonstrated by our revenue. In July, Governor Pritzker divided Illinois into 11 regions. As of November 4, all regions were operating with mitigation measures, which include a prohibition on indoor dining. VGTs are available for play from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.

Despite the reduced hours, Accel has only seen a minimal impact to net video gaming revenue, but continues to monitor the situation closely. Our October revenue will be published by the IGB in the coming weeks, which will reveal Accel had another positive month. To wrap things up I'm extremely pleased with our record third quarter performance, demonstrating the resiliency of Accel and our industry. The Accel team members continue to overcome the current challenges while delivering industry-leading customer service. We will now take your questions.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Greg Gibas. Your line is open.

Greg Gibas -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst

Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. And congrats on the record results. Good to see. I was just wondering if you could give a sense of how much of your operating expenses in the quarter were maybe onetime in nature just kind of due to getting all your locations up and running again with the new protocol and dividers?

Brian M. Carroll -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes, this is Brian. The capex was approximately over $2 million that was spent on dividers. With regard to onetime operating expenses, we -- they're included in our numbers. The only time we've adjusted EBITDA for COVID was related to primarily if we have -- when we furloughed employees and paying benefits and retention bonuses and so forth like that. So -- but the -- just to give you an idea on a monthly basis right now, COVID's probably costing us a little over $100,000 a month in operating.

Greg Gibas -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst

Got it. Okay. Thanks for clearing that up. I appreciate that. And regarding the VGTs that have been updated with the new software for the higher betting limits. Have you noticed an incremental uplift, I guess, in revenues from those machines, even though, I think you said it was only 50% or so of an updated so far?

Andrew Harry Rubenstein -- Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Yes. I mean, it's provided a lift in our overall revenue per location. So whether it's from more selection or more opportunity for people to play, we can't really discern what specific driver, but it does -- it has helped us raise the overall location revenue.

Greg Gibas -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay. Great. I guess, last one for me. Just considering we saw those three strong months in the quarter across the states. I guess I was wondering if you could comment on anything or share anything in relation to how gaming activity has trended in October relative to those previous months? And then maybe how you expect the IGBs decision to kind of limit hours of play, how you think that will affect Q4?

Andrew Harry Rubenstein -- Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

October was a very positive month. And the actual number should be published in the next 10 to 12 days. But we have seen some effect, although, it's minimal from the limitation of the hours. But it's really early to make any definitive assessment.

Greg Gibas -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst

Sure, OK. Thank you.

Bill Ketelhut -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Hi, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what you're hearing from your -- from the locations that you work with? And whether any recent restrictions are going to lead to maybe incremental financial distress or more churn?

Andrew Harry Rubenstein -- Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

I would tell you that if I own a restaurant bar and I can't sell food or beverage in doors and then the temperatures 20 degrees outside, it's going to impact me. So there is going to be some impact on their business. We've seen a little of that when we had a little cold stretch in the last couple of weeks. The question is like what is -- how long the mitigations last? And how they become -- and how they're eased? Yesterday, the governor indicated that he was going to evaluate things in the next couple of weeks. So we'll hope -- we're hopeful that they'll allow some indoor consumption. And once even some occurs, I think the overall effect will be really minimal.

Bill Ketelhut -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

That's helpful. Thank you. And I guess, kind of more on related note. There seems to be a kind of a lot of moving parts to free cash flow, given the acquisition of Tom's Amusements. And I know you're buying terminals kind of on a forward basis. Could you just give us a sense on what free cash flow conversion as a percentage of EBITDA should be like on a normalized environment, maybe ex all those growth investments?

Brian M. Carroll -- Chief Financial Officer

I can give you this, right. I can give you some ranges. Say, for example, on our current, what you've seen in Q3, probably free cash flow is about approximately around $6 million. You then have to deduct capex, but keep in mind, most of our capex is for growth purposes. To refresh maintenance capex runs us maybe $2 million to $3 million in a given year. So with that in mind, you have your -- what you've seen in Q3, you have this approximately $6 million a month of free cash flow, less however we spend for growth capex, purchasing equipment, and that could be about, I'd say, on average, about $2 million to $2.5 million per month.

Bill Ketelhut -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Got it, thank you. And I guess, one last one, I'll sneak in here, if I can. Is there anything that you've kind of learned as you spent more time in Georgia over the last quarter?

Andrew Harry Rubenstein -- Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

I'd say the major lesson learned there is that we're going to have to be very prudent in choosing our business partners as there's a wide range of companies and operations, and some of them are more attractive to partner with and especially as a public company, we need to protect our brand and the ethics that we run our business. And there's individuals there that don't seem to be concerned about running the business with integrity.

Bill Ketelhut -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Great, thank you. That's it from me.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Steve Pizzella of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.

Steve Pizzella -- Deutsche BankQ -- Analyst

Hey, guys thanks for taking my question. Can you just talk about any insights that you might have to the type of customers you're seeing at your locations relative to the pre-pandemic visitation? We have heard from some of the regional gaming operators that they have been seeing a younger customer. I just wanted to see if that aligns with what you were seeing also?

Andrew Harry Rubenstein -- Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

I wouldn't say it's necessarily a younger customer. We're seeing some younger players. And there are, obviously, some older players that are less comfortable going out. But you got to remember, like our portfolio is so diversified geographically throughout the state that the kind of feelings or reaction to the COVID restrictions are very different depending on where you live. And so we're not seeing any major trend. But there is some individuals that -- who are elderly, they don't feel comfortable. And then for some of the younger individuals who may have gone to a casino where -- or gone to the movies or done some other activity, those players have trended toward us. And we're getting more of that visitation.

Steve Pizzella -- Deutsche BankQ -- Analyst

Okay. Great, thanks. And then can you -- just wanted to follow-up on the DraftKings deal. Can you just kind of talk us through the benefit that you received from it and any economics you could actually share from it?

Andrew Harry Rubenstein -- Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

So there's been -- as far as benefits, we've seen a few of our competitor locations decide that they wanted to move their business over to Accel when their contracts have finished because we're offering a benefit that's unique in this marketplace. So we've seen that. We're going to get some new customers. People also are opening up new establishments that want to have that feature for their guests. Financially, we, today, don't have a revenue share as we don't have a license for sports betting.

But we are an affiliate and are receiving compensation from DraftKings as we're getting a lot of sign-ups from players and that benefits being shared with the establishments that the player signs up at. So -- or they acknowledge that they kind of got the information. So it's very early to measure that. But we have got a fairly significant amount of sign-ups since we kicked this off. And DraftKings is, I would guess doing well in the state of Illinois in terms of player acquisition and player communication. And we were a form of that communication.

Steve Pizzella -- Deutsche BankQ -- Analyst

Okay, great. Appreciate it. Thanks guys.

Your next question comes from the line of John DeCree of Union Gaming. Your line is open.

John DeCree -- Union Gaming -- Analyst

Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Andy, I I guess the first one is for you, perhaps. And then a follow-up maybe for Brian. And I'm not sure if you've added any more color. But with the equity raise in the quarter and adding some cash to the balance sheet. I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned about possibly deploying that over the next nine months or so. And I was wondering if you could give us any kind of more color guidelines as to where you'd be looking or prefer to spend that capital, would it be more likely in Illinois? Or something like you did with Tom's, perhaps in Georgia or another state, just kind of getting your sense of capital priorities?

Andrew Harry Rubenstein -- Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

There's lots of opportunities. There's still some significant things that we're working on in Illinois. And as we have the focus to explore into new markets and really establish ourselves. Those opportunities are also presenting themselves. So I think you'll see us move in a couple of different directions. And hopefully, 2021 will be pretty acquisitive year.

John DeCree -- Union Gaming -- Analyst

Thanks Andy, that's helpful. And Brian, perhaps for you. With additional liquidity on the balance sheet, your leverage ratio comes down quite a bit, and I think kind of anticipating some growth capital being deployed in 2021, as Andy had just discussed, where do you feel the right kind of leverage ratio is for Accel kind of right now kind of with growth capital to deployed and lift out and kind of is there a range that you guys feel comfortable with and want to be in?

Brian M. Carroll -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes, John. I mean more recently, just because of a little bit of disruptions, we were as high as around 4. And typically, we might get -- obviously, we're delevering back historically, we've always been comfort around the two to three range, and then we would lever up if we did an acquisition and then kind of fall back down pretty quickly just because of our free cash flow. And -- but right now, like I said, we're below 4. And so it's kind of a -- historically, since we've been in business, we've done it that way. So typically, once everything levels off, we feel pretty comfort around two to 3. Did I answer your question?

John DeCree -- Union Gaming -- Analyst

It does. That's perfect. Thanks, guys.

There are no further questions over the phone lines at this time. I call -- I turn the call back over to Andy Rubenstein.

Andrew Harry Rubenstein -- Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Just wanted to thank everyone for listening today. Hopefully, the mitigation from our governor will be modified and reduced in the coming weeks. And for all of you that live in Illinois and around the country, please continue to wear your masks because they will only help our industry as well as to mitigate the effects of the COVID environment. Have a good day. Thank you.

Even those consumers who aren't afraid of gathering in a large crowd may still be leery of splurging.

There are some entertainment names, however, that are not only surviving in this challenging economic environment, but thriving in it. Others are positioning smartly for the recovery that should take shape once the COVID-19 pandemic is finally over.

Sony (NYSE:SNE), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) are among those names worth considering right now as stock investments. Let's find out a bit more about these three entertainment stocks.

1. Sony

You may see Sony as the long-time maker of tape recorders, television sets, and camcorders, but Sony is so much more than that these days. In fact, consumer electronics only make up about a fourth of the company's revenue. Another fourth comes from its video gaming business centered around PlayStation consoles. Cameras, movie production, and music publishing each make up around 12% of Sony's top line, while its financial services arm drives roughly 16% of its sales.

This revenue diversity has not only allowed Sony to smooth out erratic sales and earnings, but it also gives the company opportunities to focus on what's working well.

The real game-changer as we head out of 2020 and into 2021, however, is a reinvigorated gaming industry.

Ratings agency Nielsen reported earlier this year that at the peak of lockdowns, 82% of the world's consumers were playing video games of some sort. Even as recently as August, U.S. consumer spending on video games and hardware was up 37% year over year, according to market research firm NPD Group. And the company specifically noted that its subscription-based video game service had seen decided growth in recent months. With the launch of Sony's next-generation PlayStation 5 console slated for later this month, the company should see strong demand from now-hooked gamers who may be on the hunt for something newer and better. Sony says it's aiming to outsell the PlayStation 4 in its first year of launch, which saw the purchase of 7.6 million units. That's huge.

The clincher: The version of the PlayStation 5 that doesn't come with a disc drive not only costs $100 less than the disc-drive version that will retail for $499, but it will also steer consumers toward Sony's online menu of game downloads. Those digital downloads generally mean higher margins on game sales.

2. Comcast

Most investors think Comcast is primarily a cable television company, and as such, a name to steer clear of. Cord-cutting is killing the business segment. That line of thinking is flawed, though.

Yes, Comcast is the owner of cable brand Xfinity, which lost another 273,000 customers last quarter. That brings the two-year attrition tally to nearly 2 million people who've canceled their Xfinity cable service.

But cable is only a fraction of Comcast's business, and the company is adding subscribers to a much more important and much more profitable offering. Last quarter's $5.4 billion worth of cable revenue only accounted for 22% of the company's top line, and during the same quarter, it added 633,000 new high-speed internet customers. It's added over 3 million broadband subscribers in just the past couple of years, and the internet-customer relationship is one that can be leveraged in a lot of ways, like offering wireless phone service or ad-supported streaming TV.

Yes, Comcast continues to hurt in other ways. It's also the owner of NBCUniversal, which is a TV and film presence. NBC is on the wrong side of the cord-cutting movement, and theaters have been shut down for the better part of the year.

Comcast is adapting on those fronts too, however. Its ad-supported streaming platform, Peacock, now boasts 22 million viewers since its public debut in mid-July, and while it's not yet the new norm, Universal has found respectable success in bypassing theaters and selling new films directly to consumers.

Comcast can survive a shrinking cable TV market.

3. Caesars Entertainment

Finally, add Caesars Entertainment to your list of entertainment stocks to buy.

It's suffered its fair share of problems in 2020. Just when it looked like the company might be able to shrug of the impact and drama related to its 2015 bankruptcy and subsequent restructuring, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the casino and resort industry in a hurry. The United States gambling business contracted 79% during the second quarter of the year, according to the American Gaming Association.

The company is using the slow time to maneuver for what the world may look like once the pandemic is in the rearview mirror. In September, it confirmed a $3.7 billion bid for U.K.-based bookmaker William Hill (OTC:WIMHY), and just a couple of weeks before that, it entered into a joint venture with Walt Disney's ESPN and DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG). Both deals put Caesars Entertainment in a better position to plug into a fragmented but fast-growing sports betting and online gambling market that could be worth $150 billion per year.

To this end, three more U.S. states legalized sports betting with last week's election, bringing the total to 25. Caesars Entertainment is just following the trend.",draftkings,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.417, 'pos': 0.583, 'compound': 0.7906}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.659, 'pos': 0.341, 'compound': 0.6908}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.659, 'pos': 0.341, 'compound': 0.6908}]",0.3454,0.7906,0.3454,0.49379999999999996,Positive,Positive,Very Positive,Positive
