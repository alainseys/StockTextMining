Apple Ditching Intel With Its New Macs Could Be the Start of Something Big,Motley Fool,6 days ago,"The new MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini are now available for pre-order, and all are powered by Apple's internally designed M1 CPU.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/11/apple-ditching-intel-with-its-new-macs-could-be-th/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced new Mac hardware on Tuesday, and the devices aren't powered by central processing units (CPUs) from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The new MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini are now available for pre-order, and all are powered by Apple's internally designed M1 CPU.

Apple announced in June that it was beginning a two-year initiative to shift to internally designed chips, and the new M1-powered Mac computers could mark a transition that sends shockwaves through the semiconductor industry. Some analysts think that Apple's move could reignite intense competition in CPUs.

Apple has been using chips built on Intel's x86 architecture since 2006, but it's now pivoting to its own solutions based on ARM Holdings architecture. The M1 chips have been designed in-house at Apple and will likely be fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.

Apple's aggressive shift to proprietary chips for its Mac computers presents another challenge for Intel at a time when the semiconductor giant is facing setbacks on multiple fronts. Intel's seven-nanometer (7nm) chips were delayed to 2022, and Apple's jump to internally designed ARM processors could also help pave the way for a mobile-processing leader like Qualcomm to gain ground in PCs and laptops.

Intel's x86 architecture has been the standard for PCs and laptops, but Apple's moves could result in ARM architecture gaining greater software support and ultimately making greater gains in the category. ARM is set to be acquired by NVIDIA in a $40 billion deal.

The semiconductor space is going through some big shake-ups. 5G is driving surging demand and adding incentive for large players to make big acquisitions.

Apple's silicon delivers improved performance while significantly enhancing power efficiency, leading to massive gains in battery life.

Developing the M1 cost billions, but the new chip could still bode well for Apple's Mac margins in the long run.

Ditching Intel

For starters, Intel chips cost hundreds of dollars each. Apple has undoubtedly secured volume discounts, but how much it pays the chip giant has never been clear. Analysts estimate that Intel sells about $3.4 billion in chips to Apple annually, but lacking unit sales data, it's difficult to estimate how much Apple pays for each processor.

By switching to its own processors, Apple will pay far less -- just the manufacturing costs that it pays to foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM).

Investors have long anticipated these cost savings, but they didn't know what Apple would do with them. Would Apple pass along those savings to consumers in the form of lower prices, or pocket them to expand margins?

A little bit of both

Ahead of the event, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee estimated that the shift would result in $75 per unit in cost savings. The analyst expected Apple to offer a new laptop priced in between the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which could boost demand and sell more units.

It turns out that the answer is a mix of both strategies. The M1-powered MacBook Air and MacBook Pro have the same respective starting prices, but the M1-powered Mac Mini is getting a $100 price cut. The MacBook Air is the Cupertino tech giant's most popular model, so most of those cost savings will translate into higher margins.

However, it could take some time for those higher margins to materialize. Generally speaking, processors built on the newest manufacturing technologies -- in this case, TMSC's 5-nanometer process -- often run into low yields as the foundry works out early kinks. Low yields lead to higher unit costs, as some of the silicon wafer ends up wasted. As the manufacturing process matures, yields improve, and costs come down.

Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong believes this may be why Apple kept the M1-powered MacBooks at the same price points. But over time, the costs per unit should decline and result in greater profitability. Once the rest of the Mac lineup is transitioned to Apple processors, earnings per share could increase by an estimated $0.13, or about 3%, according to Cowen analyst Krish Sankar.

Why You Should Be Buying This Tech Stock in November,Motley Fool,5 days ago,"The chipmaker reportedly gets a substantial chunk of its revenue from Apple, and its largest customer supplied 21% of the total revenue last quarter. Synaptics' ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/12/why-you-should-be-buying-this-tech-stock-november/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Synaptics (NASDAQ:SYNA) has beaten the broader stock market handsomely over the past year thanks to its shift to a higher-margin business model, and it looks like the shares have more upside to offer given the company's latest quarterly results.

The chipmaker's fiscal 2021 first-quarter earnings jumped significantly over the prior-year period on the back of strong momentum across the PC, mobile, and the Internet of Things (IoT) businesses. Synaptics exceeded its own expectations last quarter, and claims to have a nice pipeline of design wins and new product ramps that could help it move into a higher gear in this new fiscal year.

Let's see why Synaptics could remain a top tech stock and sustain its impressive rally.

Synaptics is making the right moves

Synaptics' fiscal first-quarter revenue came in at $328.4 million, down 3% over the prior-year period but higher than the midpoint of the company's guidance range of $315 million to $335 million. The lower revenue was because Synaptics' now-divested TDDI (touch and display driver integration) business was a part of the mobile segment in the year-ago quarter.

The liquid-crystal display (LCD) TDDI business generated $131 million in revenue in the first half of fiscal 2020 (about $65 million per quarter). So investors shouldn't be worried about the company's revenue decline, as it managed to substantially improve its margin profile thanks to the divestment.

Synaptics reported non-GAAP gross margin of 49.7% in the previous quarter, a huge jump over the prior-year period's figure of 41.5% and the highest level it has seen in over seven years. The company also clocked its highest operating margin in over six years. The margin gains translated into a nice earnings bump, with Synaptics reporting adjusted earnings of $1.85 per share, compared to $1.22 per share in the year-ago quarter.

The company is expected to enjoy strong earnings growth through the new fiscal year thanks to the divestment of the TDDI business and its focus on the higher-margin organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display driver segment. Rosenblatt Securities estimates that the sale of the TDDI business could boost Synaptics' earnings by $0.45 to $0.55 per share in fiscal 2021.

Major catalysts ahead

Synaptics' mobile business supplied 40% of its total revenue last quarter, and it is playing a key role in driving up its margins as the smartphone market shifts from LCDs to OLEDs. The company anticipates 10 new smartphones equipped with its OLED touch controllers to hit the market in the coming months, though it may have a huge winner on its hands in the form of the new Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 12 models.

Synaptics management pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that:

We also had our major handset OEM [original equipment manufacturer] announce their new flagship phones last month powered by our OLED touch controller.

The chipmaker reportedly gets a substantial chunk of its revenue from Apple, and its largest customer supplied 21% of the total revenue last quarter. Synaptics' mobile revenue shot up 25% year over year after adjusting for the sale of the TDDI business, and it is likely to sustain its momentum given reports that Apple is preparing to increase production and ship over 200 million units next year. The new iPhones could drive a mega upgrade cycle for Apple, and Synaptics could ride on the smartphone giant's coattails.

Looking beyond mobile, Synaptics is turning up the heat in the IoT business. The segment accounted for 35% of Synaptics' revenue last quarter, and it is expected to exceed the mobile business in size in the fiscal second quarter. The IoT business is benefiting from a broad range of growth trends in video interface solutions, audio chips, and smart homes.

With the IoT chip market expected to clock double-digit growth rates in the coming years, according to third-party estimates, it isn't surprising to see why Synaptics sees better days ahead in this business. So, investors who have been on the sidelines so far should take a closer look at Synaptics, as it has the ingredients to keep growing at a nice clip.

Finally, Synaptics trades at an attractive valuation. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24 is way lower than the five-year average multiple of 94. Meanwhile, a forward P/E ratio of 14.6 points toward future earnings growth, which Synaptics should be able to deliver given the catalysts it is sitting on.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.927, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.2023}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.927, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.2023}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.10115,0.0,0.10115,0.06743333333333333,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Positive,Neutral,Somewhat Positive

It has been a front-runner in the technology sector ever since its early days and its products have helped propel its stock price, making it one of the largest companies in the world by market cap.

Despite its already massive size, Apple continues to report growth. Still, Apple's size is weighing down on its growth rate and if the recent growth trend continues, it's unlikely that Apple's share price performance for the next decade can match the past.

Fortunately, there are many other leading tech stocks with better prospects than Apple that investors can consider. One of them is Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY).

The rise of a major tech company

Tencent is the No. 1 player in China across multiple business segments: online games, mobile messaging, online video, online payment, and music, just to mention a few. Its flagship social media app, WeChat, has 1.2 billion monthly active users (MAUs), behind only Facebook, which has 2.7 billion MAUs.

It didn't begin as a sure-win business. It started as a one-product company focusing on QQ -- an instant messaging software -- in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The product became a hit among users, making it the de facto instant messaging software in China during the PC era. Tencent then went on to provide additional services -- online games, entertainment, news, and more -- to delight its hundreds of millions of users. Its crown jewel, WeChat, came much later, and in many ways is an evolved version of QQ tailored for the mobile era.

Why is Tencent so successful

Among all the things that have contributed to Tencent's success, two stand out: its massive user base and its diversified business model.

The former is a result of Tencent's leadership in social messaging tools, which are extremely popular among Chinese users thanks to the strong network effect -- where every additional user will make its network more valuable to all existing users.

Unlike its peers such as WhatsApp, which remains mainly a messaging app, WeChat went further by offering all kinds of other services, including e-commerce, online food ordering, payments, blogging, games, and music. These additional services not only make WeChat extremely sticky among its users, but they also became new income streams for Tencent.

The result? A diversified and profitable technology conglomerate. Between 2004, the year of its IPO, and 2019, Tencent grew revenue and net profit by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47%, and 43%, respectively. It might seem that its business model runs the risk of making it a jack-of-all-trades and a master of none, but instead of doing everything on its own, Tencent has extensive partnerships (including holding stakes) with other companies in areas including e-commerce and online food delivery. These relationships help solidify its ecosystem.

A strength you may be overlooking



Many investors don't know that Tencent is probably one of the best (if not the best) capital allocators in the world. According to South China Morning Post, Tencent had invested in about 700 companies for the decade ended in 2019, many of which have either gone public or become unicorns, private companies with a valuation of more than $1 billion.

Some of its better-known investments are Pinduoduo, Meituan, JD, Sea Ltd, EPIC games, and Didi. Tencent owns more than 10% of each of those companies. It also owns minority stakes in leading companies like Tesla, Snap, Spotify, and Uber. As of June 30, these investments had a value of about $77 billion.

These companies are leaders in their respective fields, and Tencent stands to benefit as they continue to grow. With its streams of cash coming in each year, Tencent will likely continue its investments in other companies to create value for its shareholders.

Nonetheless, there's a risk that future investments might not be as successful. Hence, investors should look out for potential misallocation of capital, especially if it ventures into industries far beyond its core competence.

Tencent as a long-term investment

Tencent is a rare combination of a great business operator and a successful capital allocator.

I think Tencent's future is equally bright, if not brighter, than its past. It has huge potential to grow its existing businesses in advertising, fintech, and healthcare, and also expand its younger, enterprise-facing businesses such as cloud computing.

At around a $745 billion market cap, Tencent is already a gigantic company. But a decade from now, it could be worth much more. It has a good chance to outperform Apple thanks to its smaller size and its proven capital allocation strategies.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.655, 'neu': 0.345, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.2263}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.805, 'pos': 0.195, 'compound': 0.4404}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.778, 'pos': 0.222, 'compound': 0.7506}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.778, 'pos': 0.222, 'compound': 0.7506}]",0.7506,0.10705,0.7506,0.5360833333333334,Positive,Very Positive,Somewhat Positive,Very Positive

As expected, the chipmaker's revenue and earnings crushed Wall Street's estimates as it rode the initial production run of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) newest iPhone 12 series and the overall growth of the 5G smartphone market. More importantly, the company's fiscal first-quarter guidance turned out to be much better than what the market expected.

It anticipates year-over-year revenue growth of almost 18% at the midpoint of its guidance range of $1.04 billion to $1.07 billion. Adjusted earnings are expected to jump from $1.68 per share in the prior-year period to $2.06 per share this quarter. But don't be surprised to see Skyworks blast past those numbers once again, as the company is at the beginning of a multi-year tailwind that could boost its biggest business.

The mobile business is on fire

Skyworks got nearly 71% of its total revenue from the mobile business last quarter, recording double-digit growth compared to the prior-year period. This business benefited from the launch of Apple's new 5G iPhones, as evident from the comments made by Skyworks CEO Liam Griffin on the latest earnings conference call. He said:

Notably, the world's leading smartphone manufacturer has just now released its entire lineup of new 5G devices, a key catalyst underpinning our growth thesis.

With Skyworks getting over half of its total revenue from sales of mobile chips to Apple, the success of the new iPhone 12 lineup is going to play an important role in the company's fortunes. Analysts were earlier predicting that Apple could manufacture 60 million to 65 million units of its new phones this year. But their aggressive pricing and Apple's huge installed base of users looking to upgrade to 5G could help the company beat those targets by a wide margin.

DigiTimes predicts that Apple could exit 2020 with sales of 80 million iPhone 12 units. Meanwhile, Chinese investment consultancy Cinda Securities estimates that Apple could move between 230 million and 240 million iPhone 12 units next year. The last time Apple moved more than 230 million iPhones in a year was back in 2015 when the iPhone 6S models were launched. Those phones supported LTE (long-term evolution)-Advanced networks with twice the download speeds of the previous-generation devices.

Fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks are expected to be 20 times faster than 4G, at least theoretically. So there is a good chance that users might upgrade to the new iPhones in big numbers once again and help Skyworks ship more chips to its largest customer, paving the way for stronger growth in the forthcoming quarters.

Skyworks has more tricks up its sleeve

While Apple and mobile phones dominate Skyworks' revenue, the company is expanding its presence in other areas to diversify its business. Its revenue from the broad markets segment (including other verticals such as the Internet of Things (IoT), automotive, consumer, aerospace & defense, and medical and healthcare) also increased in the double digits last quarter.

This segment is benefiting from an increase in demand for chips related to WiFi 6, embedded automotive connectivity, and Skyworks' relationship with major automotive OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) such as BMW and Tesla.

For instance, Skyworks' WiFi 6 solutions are being adopted by the likes of Netgear, Asus, and Amazon, along with other OEMs. The chipmaker is unlikely to lose momentum in this market anytime soon, as the share of WiFi 6 devices is expected to increase to 50% of the overall WiFi market by 2024, compared to 10% at the end of 2019.

On the other hand, the recent gains clocked by Skyworks in the industrial IoT market could be sustainable in the long run. Industrial IoT is another fast-growing space that's expected to clock annual growth of over 29% through 2025, according to third-party estimates.

The stock trades at 19 times forward earnings and is expected to maintain double-digit earnings growth over the coming years, according to analyst estimates compiled by Yahoo! Finance. So given all the catalysts that Skyworks is sitting on and its newly found momentum, it looks like a solid bet for investors looking for a top tech stock that's well-placed to take advantage of new tech trends.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.846, 'pos': 0.154, 'compound': 0.25}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.0,0.25,0.0,0.08333333333333333,Somewhat Positive,Neutral,Somewhat Positive,Neutral

It's not an idea everyone agrees with. Even if the Americas market is nearing plausible saturation, China and the rest of Asia -- India in particular -- still hold lots of growth potential. Indeed, with the first Apple store set to open in India next year, it's clear Apple is ready to act on the opportunity.

It's not a bad bet either, on the surface. Although India became the world's second-biggest smartphone market last year, according to data from Counterpoint Research, the 158 million smartphones sold in India in 2019 is only about 11% of its population of 1.37 billion people. That leaves room for smartphone market growth on the order of 11% to 14% per year for the next few years, depending on the forecaster. And unlike other parts of the world, India's smartphone sales are on a clear growth trajectory.

Shareholders counting on this market to be a growth driver for Apple's iPhone, however, may want to think again.

The iPhone is losing steam

Don't jump to extreme conclusions. The iPhone is still a powerhouse. The sale of apps and digital downloads being facilitated by these devices is an increasingly important piece of Apple's revenue mix. But iPhone sales of $137.8 billion of its recently ended fiscal year still made up the lion's share of its business, accounting for half of the company's top line.

Like it or not, though, iPhone revenue is dwindling. The graphic below tells the tale.

Market research company IDC fleshes the idea out in a slightly different way. Plotting its estimated iPhone unit sales (as opposed to the iPhone revenue Apple still publishes) for each quarter of the last several years shows us unit sales of the iPhone are indeed shrinking, as are overall sales of smartphones.

Some suggest India could be a reason to expect rekindled iPhone growth. The country is just now in the heart of its smartphone evolution. That new business is up for grabs, and clearly some manufacturers are grabbing it.

The reality of the matter is, however, that Apple hasn't proven to be a particularly marketable brand there despite iPhones being available in India since 2008. IDC's look at India's smartphone market for the three-month stretch ending in September doesn't even register Apple among the nation's top five smartphone vendors. Those names are, from biggest to smallest, Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF), Samsung (OTC: SSNLF), Vivo, realme, and OPPO. Those companies collectively accounted for 90% of Q3's smartphone sales in India, mirroring their aggregate market share from the same quarter a year earlier.

While it's difficult to pinpoint Apple's present piece of India's smartphone market, some put it on the order of 2% of the country's total. This remarkably low interest from Indian consumers is telling.

The premium price is the problem

Those who've followed the story will point out that Apple's not exactly been competing on a level playing field in India. Namely, foreign consumer tech companies such as Apple haven't been able to open stores solely dedicated to the sale of their own hardware. By law, a foreign company had to offer competing hardware. Apple chose not to build a retail presence at all rather than open the door to lower-cost competing products. However, this law has since been reversed, allowing the company to start planning its first-ever store in India next year.

In the meantime, fans tout the fact that at least within India's premium portion of its smartphone market, Apple is as competitive as rivals like the aforementioned Samsung, Vivo, and a manufacturer called OnePlus. Research from Canalys suggests sales of Apple's smartphones grew at a double-digit pace during the third quarter, boosted by the opening of an online Apple store aimed at Indian consumers.

In absolute terms, though, it means little. Apple still only delivered fewer than 800,000 iPhones to India last quarter, or right around 2% of all the iPhones IDC says Apple delivered during this time.

It's not likely that the high-end sliver of the market is going to suddenly develop anytime soon either. IDC notes that the average selling price for smartphones In India last quarter was a mere $156, with more than 80% of buyers spending less than $200 for their devices, mirroring year-ago numbers when the global economy was in a much better condition. IDC's Associate Research Manager Upasana Joshi added to the report that he ""expects the low-end and mid-range segment to continue being the volume driver,"" with ""upgrades and affordable 5G offerings in the US$200-$500 segment ... expected to drive growth.""

For the time being, Apple's iPhones in India remain priced above $500. There's the rub for a cost-conscious market.

Bottom line

Never say never. Apple now assembles the lower-cost iPhone SE in India, which potentially opens the door to a lower-priced offering in the country. It's just not chosen to make that lower-priced offering -- at least not yet. Until the company starts to make price compromises that just aren't Apple-like, India's not going to be a big hardware growth driver.

Why You Shouldn't Worry About Apple's Declining iPhone Revenue,Motley Fool,1 week ago,Apple's business momentum is better than its fiscal fourth-quarter results implied. Daniel Sparks.

Though some investors may have been concerned with the tech giant's year-over-year decline in iPhone revenue, there's a good explanation for this. In fact, there are even reasons to be optimistic about Apple's iPhone business.

In this segment from Fool Live's ""The Wrap,"" host Jason Hall and technology specialists Daniel Sparks and Daniel Vena take a closer look at why investors shouldn't sweat the important segment's 21% year-over-year decline in revenue.

Recorded on Oct. 30, 2020.

Jason Hall: With so much volatility in the market, let's do a high-level look at a few big names that have been touched on already but continue to be a major focus throughout the day. Also, likely holdings for a lot of you watching. Apple, I haven't looked at it in the past few minutes, but earlier, it was down pretty sharply.

Danny Vena: Six percent.

Daniel Sparks: Six percent.

Jason Hall: So it's fallen more. It actually was down five percent most of the day. Daniel, what should investors make of this?

Daniel Sparks: Well, also just zooming out a bit, it is down from highs of $138. Now, it's at 108. When we zoom out a bit, just notable, pretty big pullback here. Of course, they had a huge run so the correction probably makes a little bit of sense. I just think that this one is really interesting. Apple's covered so well. I do feel the mark has been missed with the way people are reacting to this. When you take a look at what's going on here, the timing of the iPhone release was different this year. Typically, it's in the end of the quarter that just ended, but instead, it was a few weeks into the final quarter. That explains the decline in product revenue. Meanwhile, services revenue is chugging along super nicely and even some of the other product segments. Then when you look at the commentary in the earnings calls, it's pretty optimistic. I guess the iPhone 11 revenue growth was really strong going into the middle of September, and then basically, people are just waiting for the delayed iPhone 12, which is also reportedly supposed to lead to iPhone revenue growth in the current quarter. That's as rapid as I could get on that. I'll just say I think in this case, that maybe there is a little bit of a headline reaction that's not quite justified. What do you think, Danny?

Danny Vena: I think you're right. The fact that Apple would have released the iPhone last quarter if the situation had been normal, it's anything but.

Between 1965 and 2019, he led Berkshire to an average annual gain of 20.3%, which more than doubles the 10% average annual return of the S&P 500, inclusive of dividends paid, over the same time frame. In aggregate, Buffett has overseen a greater than 2,700,000% gain in Berkshire Hathaway's stock in 55 years.

When Warren Buffett buys or sells a stock, Wall Street and retail investors pay close attention.

However, since completing the Precision Castparts acquisition in early 2016, the Oracle of Omaha hasn't been doing a lot of buying -- at least as evidenced by the company's growing cash pile. The company's third-quarter operating results showed $145.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents in Berkshire's coffers, which is a little over $1 billion below an all-time high.

Dig a bit deeper, however, and you'll discover that Buffett has been a bit more active on the buying front than it seems. Since the beginning of 2016, he's put approximately $67 billion to work in the following three stocks.

Apple: $35.3 billion

More than half of that capital has been used to scoop up shares of tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which comprises nearly half of Berkshire Hathaway's invested assets.

Buffett's company owns a little over 1 billion shares of Apple, or 5.6% of all outstanding shares after the iPhone-maker's 4-for-1 stock split. According to Berkshire's annual shareholder letter released in February, the company's cost basis on Apple is $35.287 billion. That first purchase came in the first quarter of 2016; since then, Apple has become one of the few companies that Buffett and his team have felt comfortable piling into.

Among Apple's greatest assets is its branding. Apple has become one of the most recognized brands in the world. It has an almost cult-like following, with customer lines wrapping around its stores when new devices are released.

Apple is also set to benefit from the launch of its iPhone 12 on Nov. 13. This will be the first iPhone to feature 5G connectivity. Though wireless providers are still rolling out 5G infrastructure, the first major upgrade to wireless download speeds in a decade should produce a sustainable technology upgrade cycle for businesses and consumers.

Furthermore, Berkshire's honorary ""third business"" is expected to see its operating margins expand as CEO Tim Cook realizes his vision. Cook has guided Apple to become more of a services and wearables company in recent years. Services can be especially lucrative given the high margins and predictable cash flow associated with subscriptions.

Through this past weekend, Berkshire Hathaway was up almost $84 billion on Apple from the company's cost basis.

Bank of America: Around $10 billion

Another stock that Buffett and his team have been throwing money at on a regular basis is Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).

During the third quarter of 2017, Warren Buffett exercised his warrants on BofA and converted his company's preferred shares to common stock. When Berkshire filed its 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in mid-November 2017, the company held 679 million shares.

An SEC filing made public shortly after Berkshire made a handful of third-quarter purchases shows that the company now holds north of 1.03 billion shares of Bank of America stock. Between Q3 2017 and Q3 2020, Buffett's company has added 353,852,006 shares. With BofA shares mostly hovering between $28 and $35 over those three years, and Buffett scooping up shares in recent months, I've ""guesstimated"" he's about $10 billion buying BofA stock over the past three years.

Why Bank of America? First, it's the most interest-sensitive of all big bank stocks. When interest rates eventually begin to rise (most likely by 2024), no money-center bank will see their interest income expand faster than BofA.

Bank of America has also cleaned up its act in a big way since the Great Recession. It has more liquidity on hand to deal with economic downturns, has vastly improved the credit quality of its loan portfolio, has successfully promoted digital engagement, and has done a good job of keeping noninterest expenses down by consolidating branches.

Berkshire Hathaway: Approximately $22 billion

Aside from Apple, the only stock Buffett can't get enough of is ... his own. Over the past nine quarters, Buffett and his team have repurchased about $22 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock, including $9.3 billion in Q3 2020 and $15.7 billion on a year-to-date basis.

Berkshire Hathaway spent much of the past seven years valued at between 131% and 159% of its book value. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recession has opened the door for Buffett and his team to repurchase shares of his own company for between 115% and 130% of the company's book value. Repurchasing shares of common stock can positively affect earnings per share and can make a company look more attractive from a fundamental perspective.

On a broader scale, Buffett has aligned Berkshire Hathaway's success with that of the U.S. and global economy. He's packed the company's investment portfolio with cyclical businesses, with well over 90% of invested assets tied to technology, financials, and consumer staples. Since periods of economic expansion last considerably longer than recessions, Buffett and his team are simply playing a numbers game that they're bound to win.

With nearly $146 billion in cash still at Buffett's disposal and no true elephant deals on the horizon, don't be surprised if the Oracle of Omaha continues gobbling up Berkshire Hathaway stock.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.459, 'pos': 0.541, 'compound': 0.7096}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.459, 'pos': 0.541, 'compound': 0.7096}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.23653333333333335,0.0,0.23653333333333335,0.1576888888888889,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Positive,Neutral,Somewhat Positive

If you find yourself separating companies into tech versus non-tech, break this habit swiftly -- or you'll risk unnecessarily limiting your portfolio.

It's not one industry

Investors may hear the term ""tech stocks"" and think of the high-flying companies that scarred millions in the Tech Bubble at the beginning of the century -- but so many different companies fall within the realm of technology. The classic FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google ) are certainly quintessential technology companies, but there are plenty of other ways to invest in technology.

The entire tech sector can be broken into two very different, relatively broad categories: software and hardware. Hardware companies create the physical devices that we use day in and day out. Software companies are responsible for all that makes the hardware function. This division alone shows the variety of companies that fall within the tech sector: a chip manufacturing company makes a very different product than the company that makes the operating software for your laptop.

There are even more industries within the division of hardware vs software: data centers, semiconductors, personal computing, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and the internet of things, to name a few.

These industries may appeal to completely different investors, so don't fall into the common mistake of comparing disparate companies simply because each depends on technology. Their relative merits also depend on what you're looking for as an investment.

For investors seeking a stable business, Apple and its growing dividend might be right for you. If you're a more growth-oriented investor, there are plenty of businesses in their early stages, such as real estate disruptor, Redfin (NASDAQ:RDFN). Investments in technology run the gamut, even offering potential value plays such as legacy software provider IBM. Technology is an investing microcosm unto itself, so don't lump its wonderful opportunities into one group.

What's wrong with technology anyway?

Saying ""I own too many tech stocks,"" blinds you to countless opportunities. Instead of viewing tech as one investment category, think of technology as a company's ability to disrupt. Technology is a differentiator that gives a company an edge over the competition, and makes life easier for their customers --- we still aren't very far from the days where shipping and handling was a substantial fee that we'd have to pay in order to buy product we wouldn't get for weeks.

As Foolish investors, our job is to focus on the long game. Technology is the future, but it also offers a lot of amazing business models in the present. Tech-focused companies tend to be able to expand more rapidly than their non-tech-oriented peers, giving them a leg up on the competition. Companies like Redfin, which exist entirely online, can leverage their internet-based platforms to grow faster than their competitors, who are tied to physical offices and all their attendant expenses. Redfin passes the savings on overhead costs onto customers as lower commission rates, which in turn saves its customers thousands.

The SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) model is another example where ""tech stocks"" have an edge for the foreseeable future. Where it once charged users a hefty sum for one-time software purchases, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) now sells its software via subscription. This makes life easier for customers who don't want to pay thousands of dollars for software up front, while Adobe gets predictable recurring revenue. Companies that are more able to disrupt the status quo and improve the lives of their customers tend be great investments--- and let's face it, we aren't going away from technology any time soon.

We need technology in all its forms

Technology is not a single industry. If you treat all tech-focused companies the same, you are limiting yourself. Comparing Apple to Redfin is comparing apples to oranges, and you should assess them very differently. Redfin is much earlier in its growth story than Apple, so if you are going to invest in the real estate disruptor, start with a much smaller position than you would with Apple -- preferably less than 2% of your overall portfolio.

If you still believe your portfolio is too tech-heavy, invest in whatever allows you to sleep comfortably --- maybe an index fund like the S&P 500. Just remember that a wide variety of companies use technology to make the world a better place for their stakeholders, and their diversity of business models and growth prospects have something to offer for nearly every investor, no matter what your priorities or risk tolerance might be.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.306, 'neu': 0.694, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.296}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.822, 'pos': 0.178, 'compound': 0.3818}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.822, 'pos': 0.178, 'compound': 0.3818}]",0.1909,-0.296,0.1909,0.028599999999999997,Neutral,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Negative,Somewhat Positive

The chipmaker is well placed to take advantage of the sharp growth in 5G smartphone shipments thanks to its relationships with several major original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). That's why it wasn't surprising to see Qorvo crush Wall Street's estimates in Q2 of fiscal 2021 (ending on Oct. 3, 2020) and also provide terrific guidance for the current quarter.

Let's see what's working for Qorvo and why the chipmaker is capable of delivering more upside despite clocking gains over 100% over the past few months.

Qorvo delivers yet another solid report

Qorvo has been in fine form in recent quarters thanks to the increase in demand for 5G smartphone chips. The chipmaker generated $1.06 billion in revenue last quarter, a jump of more than 31% over the prior-year period. Non-GAAP net income shot up nearly 56% year over year to $282.3 million and adjusted earnings came in at $2.43 per share as compared to $1.52 a year ago. Its non-GAAP gross margin increased 5.2 percentage points year over year to 51.7%.

Qorvo attributed its impressive growth to a multitude of factors, including an increase in chip shipments to several top-tier smartphone suppliers, new content gains, and the commencement of GaN (gallium nitride) amplifier shipments for use in 5G base stations. According to CEO Bob Bruggeworth, ""Strength was diversified across customers and supported by multiyear technology upgrade cycles, including 5G and Wi-Fi 6. Customers are requiring more and better RF in highly integrated form factors to enable their next-generation products.""

This is not the first time Qorvo has said that 5G is driving content gains. The company had earlier pointed out that each 5G smartphone could add $5 to $7 worth of content to Qorvo's kitty. It reiterated that claim once again on the latest earnings conference call, stating that ""demand for 5G is adding RF complexity and driving higher content.""

The increased RF complexity in 5G smartphones is also triggering a ""shift from discrete products to higher-value content including integrated modules in flagship and mass-market 5G smartphones."" This is great news for Qorvo, as it gets around 71% of its total revenue from selling mobile chips, and that business is unlikely to lose steam anytime soon thanks to customers like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung.

The mobile business brought in higher-than-anticipated revenue for Qorvo last quarter as Apple ramped up production of the iPhone 12 lineup. Though the chipmaker didn't point this out explicitly, it did say that ""seasonal demand effects and the ramp of 5G smartphones"" were key to the outperformance of the mobile business. With Apple reportedly accounting for a third of Qorvo's total revenue, the chipmaker was bound to get a shot in the arm.

Apple is reportedly looking to increase the production of the iPhone 12 to a range of 80 million to 85 million units this year as per third-party estimates. According to another estimate, as many as 230 million to 240 million iPhone 12 units could be shipped in 2021. This could pave the way for Qorvo to clock high growth rates in the coming quarters. Apple iPhone shipments have plateaued in recent years, but the iPhone 12 could help it regain its mojo.

More importantly, the emergence of 5G smartphones could be a multiyear catalyst for Qorvo because the shift to the new networking standard is likely to drive secular shipment growth.

Why Qorvo is still a good buy

Shares of Qorvo have nearly doubled since the end of March, but it continues to remain a solid bet for investors looking for a growth stock. The company's fiscal Q3 guidance points toward big gains once again. It anticipates $1.06 billion in revenue during the quarter ending in December, along with an adjusted gross margin of 52.5% and earnings of $2.65 per share.

The projections show substantial growth over the prior-year period's revenue of $869 million, non-GAAP gross margin of 49.3%, and earnings of $1.86 per share. Analyst estimates compiled by Yahoo! Finance predict that Qorvo could continue delivering high earnings growth rates in the future, and that looks likely considering the secular catalyst it enjoys in the form of 5G smartphone adoption.

Given that Qorvo stock trades at just 18 times forward earnings, it isn't too late for investors looking to buy a 5G stock right now, as it may have room to run higher.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.228, 'neu': 0.772, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5023}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.753, 'pos': 0.247, 'compound': 0.3182}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.753, 'pos': 0.247, 'compound': 0.3182}]",0.1591,-0.5023,0.1591,-0.06136666666666665,Somewhat Negative,Somewhat Positive,Negative,Somewhat Positive

Apple's silicon delivers improved performance while significantly enhancing power efficiency, leading to massive gains in battery life.

Developing the M1 cost billions, but the new chip could still bode well for Apple's Mac margins in the long run.

Ditching Intel

For starters, Intel chips cost hundreds of dollars each. Apple has undoubtedly secured volume discounts, but how much it pays the chip giant has never been clear. Analysts estimate that Intel sells about $3.4 billion in chips to Apple annually, but lacking unit sales data, it's difficult to estimate how much Apple pays for each processor.

By switching to its own processors, Apple will pay far less -- just the manufacturing costs that it pays to foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM).

Investors have long anticipated these cost savings, but they didn't know what Apple would do with them. Would Apple pass along those savings to consumers in the form of lower prices, or pocket them to expand margins?

A little bit of both

Ahead of the event, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee estimated that the shift would result in $75 per unit in cost savings. The analyst expected Apple to offer a new laptop priced in between the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which could boost demand and sell more units.

It turns out that the answer is a mix of both strategies. The M1-powered MacBook Air and MacBook Pro have the same respective starting prices, but the M1-powered Mac Mini is getting a $100 price cut. The MacBook Air is the Cupertino tech giant's most popular model, so most of those cost savings will translate into higher margins.

However, it could take some time for those higher margins to materialize. Generally speaking, processors built on the newest manufacturing technologies -- in this case, TMSC's 5-nanometer process -- often run into low yields as the foundry works out early kinks. Low yields lead to higher unit costs, as some of the silicon wafer ends up wasted. As the manufacturing process matures, yields improve, and costs come down.

Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong believes this may be why Apple kept the M1-powered MacBooks at the same price points. But over time, the costs per unit should decline and result in greater profitability. Once the rest of the Mac lineup is transitioned to Apple processors, earnings per share could increase by an estimated $0.13, or about 3%, according to Cowen analyst Krish Sankar.

Despite its already massive size, Apple continues to report growth. Still, Apple's size is weighing down on its growth rate and if the recent growth trend continues, it's unlikely that Apple's share price performance for the next decade can match the past.

Fortunately, there are many other leading tech stocks with better prospects than Apple that investors can consider. One of them is Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY).

The rise of a major tech company

Tencent is the No. 1 player in China across multiple business segments: online games, mobile messaging, online video, online payment, and music, just to mention a few. Its flagship social media app, WeChat, has 1.2 billion monthly active users (MAUs), behind only Facebook, which has 2.7 billion MAUs.

It didn't begin as a sure-win business. It started as a one-product company focusing on QQ -- an instant messaging software -- in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The product became a hit among users, making it the de facto instant messaging software in China during the PC era. Tencent then went on to provide additional services -- online games, entertainment, news, and more -- to delight its hundreds of millions of users. Its crown jewel, WeChat, came much later, and in many ways is an evolved version of QQ tailored for the mobile era.

Why is Tencent so successful

Among all the things that have contributed to Tencent's success, two stand out: its massive user base and its diversified business model.

The former is a result of Tencent's leadership in social messaging tools, which are extremely popular among Chinese users thanks to the strong network effect -- where every additional user will make its network more valuable to all existing users.

Unlike its peers such as WhatsApp, which remains mainly a messaging app, WeChat went further by offering all kinds of other services, including e-commerce, online food ordering, payments, blogging, games, and music. These additional services not only make WeChat extremely sticky among its users, but they also became new income streams for Tencent.

The result? A diversified and profitable technology conglomerate. Between 2004, the year of its IPO, and 2019, Tencent grew revenue and net profit by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47%, and 43%, respectively. It might seem that its business model runs the risk of making it a jack-of-all-trades and a master of none, but instead of doing everything on its own, Tencent has extensive partnerships (including holding stakes) with other companies in areas including e-commerce and online food delivery. These relationships help solidify its ecosystem.

A strength you may be overlooking



Many investors don't know that Tencent is probably one of the best (if not the best) capital allocators in the world. According to South China Morning Post, Tencent had invested in about 700 companies for the decade ended in 2019, many of which have either gone public or become unicorns, private companies with a valuation of more than $1 billion.

Some of its better-known investments are Pinduoduo, Meituan, JD, Sea Ltd, EPIC games, and Didi. Tencent owns more than 10% of each of those companies. It also owns minority stakes in leading companies like Tesla, Snap, Spotify, and Uber. As of June 30, these investments had a value of about $77 billion.

These companies are leaders in their respective fields, and Tencent stands to benefit as they continue to grow. With its streams of cash coming in each year, Tencent will likely continue its investments in other companies to create value for its shareholders.

Nonetheless, there's a risk that future investments might not be as successful. Hence, investors should look out for potential misallocation of capital, especially if it ventures into industries far beyond its core competence.

Tencent as a long-term investment

Tencent is a rare combination of a great business operator and a successful capital allocator.

I think Tencent's future is equally bright, if not brighter, than its past. It has huge potential to grow its existing businesses in advertising, fintech, and healthcare, and also expand its younger, enterprise-facing businesses such as cloud computing.

At around a $745 billion market cap, Tencent is already a gigantic company. But a decade from now, it could be worth much more. It has a good chance to outperform Apple thanks to its smaller size and its proven capital allocation strategies.",microsoft,msft,"[{'neg': 0.655, 'neu': 0.345, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.2263}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.805, 'pos': 0.195, 'compound': 0.4404}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.778, 'pos': 0.222, 'compound': 0.7506}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.778, 'pos': 0.222, 'compound': 0.7506}]",0.7506,0.10705,0.7506,0.5360833333333334,Positive,Very Positive,Somewhat Positive,Very Positive

It's not an idea everyone agrees with. Even if the Americas market is nearing plausible saturation, China and the rest of Asia -- India in particular -- still hold lots of growth potential. Indeed, with the first Apple store set to open in India next year, it's clear Apple is ready to act on the opportunity.

It's not a bad bet either, on the surface. Although India became the world's second-biggest smartphone market last year, according to data from Counterpoint Research, the 158 million smartphones sold in India in 2019 is only about 11% of its population of 1.37 billion people. That leaves room for smartphone market growth on the order of 11% to 14% per year for the next few years, depending on the forecaster. And unlike other parts of the world, India's smartphone sales are on a clear growth trajectory.

Shareholders counting on this market to be a growth driver for Apple's iPhone, however, may want to think again.

The iPhone is losing steam

Don't jump to extreme conclusions. The iPhone is still a powerhouse. The sale of apps and digital downloads being facilitated by these devices is an increasingly important piece of Apple's revenue mix. But iPhone sales of $137.8 billion of its recently ended fiscal year still made up the lion's share of its business, accounting for half of the company's top line.

Like it or not, though, iPhone revenue is dwindling. The graphic below tells the tale.

Market research company IDC fleshes the idea out in a slightly different way. Plotting its estimated iPhone unit sales (as opposed to the iPhone revenue Apple still publishes) for each quarter of the last several years shows us unit sales of the iPhone are indeed shrinking, as are overall sales of smartphones.

Some suggest India could be a reason to expect rekindled iPhone growth. The country is just now in the heart of its smartphone evolution. That new business is up for grabs, and clearly some manufacturers are grabbing it.

The reality of the matter is, however, that Apple hasn't proven to be a particularly marketable brand there despite iPhones being available in India since 2008. IDC's look at India's smartphone market for the three-month stretch ending in September doesn't even register Apple among the nation's top five smartphone vendors. Those names are, from biggest to smallest, Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF), Samsung (OTC: SSNLF), Vivo, realme, and OPPO. Those companies collectively accounted for 90% of Q3's smartphone sales in India, mirroring their aggregate market share from the same quarter a year earlier.

While it's difficult to pinpoint Apple's present piece of India's smartphone market, some put it on the order of 2% of the country's total. This remarkably low interest from Indian consumers is telling.

The premium price is the problem

Those who've followed the story will point out that Apple's not exactly been competing on a level playing field in India. Namely, foreign consumer tech companies such as Apple haven't been able to open stores solely dedicated to the sale of their own hardware. By law, a foreign company had to offer competing hardware. Apple chose not to build a retail presence at all rather than open the door to lower-cost competing products. However, this law has since been reversed, allowing the company to start planning its first-ever store in India next year.

In the meantime, fans tout the fact that at least within India's premium portion of its smartphone market, Apple is as competitive as rivals like the aforementioned Samsung, Vivo, and a manufacturer called OnePlus. Research from Canalys suggests sales of Apple's smartphones grew at a double-digit pace during the third quarter, boosted by the opening of an online Apple store aimed at Indian consumers.

In absolute terms, though, it means little. Apple still only delivered fewer than 800,000 iPhones to India last quarter, or right around 2% of all the iPhones IDC says Apple delivered during this time.

It's not likely that the high-end sliver of the market is going to suddenly develop anytime soon either. IDC notes that the average selling price for smartphones In India last quarter was a mere $156, with more than 80% of buyers spending less than $200 for their devices, mirroring year-ago numbers when the global economy was in a much better condition. IDC's Associate Research Manager Upasana Joshi added to the report that he ""expects the low-end and mid-range segment to continue being the volume driver,"" with ""upgrades and affordable 5G offerings in the US$200-$500 segment ... expected to drive growth.""

For the time being, Apple's iPhones in India remain priced above $500. There's the rub for a cost-conscious market.

Bottom line

Never say never. Apple now assembles the lower-cost iPhone SE in India, which potentially opens the door to a lower-priced offering in the country. It's just not chosen to make that lower-priced offering -- at least not yet. Until the company starts to make price compromises that just aren't Apple-like, India's not going to be a big hardware growth driver.

Or, as Canalys Research Director Rushabh Doshi arguably understated it, ""Apple's pricing strategy for its new iPhones in India needs serious consideration.""",microsoft,msft,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.242, 'neu': 0.484, 'pos': 0.274, 'compound': 0.0516}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.813, 'pos': 0.187, 'compound': 0.4404}, {'neg': 0.211, 'neu': 0.789, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.1531}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.813, 'pos': 0.187, 'compound': 0.4404}, {'neg': 0.211, 'neu': 0.789, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.1531}]",0.14365,0.0258,0.14365,0.10436666666666666,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Positive,Neutral,Somewhat Positive

Between 1965 and 2019, he led Berkshire to an average annual gain of 20.3%, which more than doubles the 10% average annual return of the S&P 500, inclusive of dividends paid, over the same time frame. In aggregate, Buffett has overseen a greater than 2,700,000% gain in Berkshire Hathaway's stock in 55 years.

When Warren Buffett buys or sells a stock, Wall Street and retail investors pay close attention.

However, since completing the Precision Castparts acquisition in early 2016, the Oracle of Omaha hasn't been doing a lot of buying -- at least as evidenced by the company's growing cash pile. The company's third-quarter operating results showed $145.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents in Berkshire's coffers, which is a little over $1 billion below an all-time high.

Dig a bit deeper, however, and you'll discover that Buffett has been a bit more active on the buying front than it seems. Since the beginning of 2016, he's put approximately $67 billion to work in the following three stocks.

Apple: $35.3 billion

More than half of that capital has been used to scoop up shares of tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which comprises nearly half of Berkshire Hathaway's invested assets.

Buffett's company owns a little over 1 billion shares of Apple, or 5.6% of all outstanding shares after the iPhone-maker's 4-for-1 stock split. According to Berkshire's annual shareholder letter released in February, the company's cost basis on Apple is $35.287 billion. That first purchase came in the first quarter of 2016; since then, Apple has become one of the few companies that Buffett and his team have felt comfortable piling into.

Among Apple's greatest assets is its branding. Apple has become one of the most recognized brands in the world. It has an almost cult-like following, with customer lines wrapping around its stores when new devices are released.

Apple is also set to benefit from the launch of its iPhone 12 on Nov. 13. This will be the first iPhone to feature 5G connectivity. Though wireless providers are still rolling out 5G infrastructure, the first major upgrade to wireless download speeds in a decade should produce a sustainable technology upgrade cycle for businesses and consumers.

Furthermore, Berkshire's honorary ""third business"" is expected to see its operating margins expand as CEO Tim Cook realizes his vision. Cook has guided Apple to become more of a services and wearables company in recent years. Services can be especially lucrative given the high margins and predictable cash flow associated with subscriptions.

Through this past weekend, Berkshire Hathaway was up almost $84 billion on Apple from the company's cost basis.

Bank of America: Around $10 billion

Another stock that Buffett and his team have been throwing money at on a regular basis is Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).

During the third quarter of 2017, Warren Buffett exercised his warrants on BofA and converted his company's preferred shares to common stock. When Berkshire filed its 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in mid-November 2017, the company held 679 million shares.

An SEC filing made public shortly after Berkshire made a handful of third-quarter purchases shows that the company now holds north of 1.03 billion shares of Bank of America stock. Between Q3 2017 and Q3 2020, Buffett's company has added 353,852,006 shares. With BofA shares mostly hovering between $28 and $35 over those three years, and Buffett scooping up shares in recent months, I've ""guesstimated"" he's about $10 billion buying BofA stock over the past three years.

Why Bank of America? First, it's the most interest-sensitive of all big bank stocks. When interest rates eventually begin to rise (most likely by 2024), no money-center bank will see their interest income expand faster than BofA.

Bank of America has also cleaned up its act in a big way since the Great Recession. It has more liquidity on hand to deal with economic downturns, has vastly improved the credit quality of its loan portfolio, has successfully promoted digital engagement, and has done a good job of keeping noninterest expenses down by consolidating branches.

Berkshire Hathaway: Approximately $22 billion

Aside from Apple, the only stock Buffett can't get enough of is ... his own. Over the past nine quarters, Buffett and his team have repurchased about $22 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock, including $9.3 billion in Q3 2020 and $15.7 billion on a year-to-date basis.

Berkshire Hathaway spent much of the past seven years valued at between 131% and 159% of its book value. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recession has opened the door for Buffett and his team to repurchase shares of his own company for between 115% and 130% of the company's book value. Repurchasing shares of common stock can positively affect earnings per share and can make a company look more attractive from a fundamental perspective.

On a broader scale, Buffett has aligned Berkshire Hathaway's success with that of the U.S. and global economy. He's packed the company's investment portfolio with cyclical businesses, with well over 90% of invested assets tied to technology, financials, and consumer staples. Since periods of economic expansion last considerably longer than recessions, Buffett and his team are simply playing a numbers game that they're bound to win.

With nearly $146 billion in cash still at Buffett's disposal and no true elephant deals on the horizon, don't be surprised if the Oracle of Omaha continues gobbling up Berkshire Hathaway stock.",microsoft,msft,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.459, 'pos': 0.541, 'compound': 0.7096}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.459, 'pos': 0.541, 'compound': 0.7096}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.23653333333333335,0.0,0.23653333333333335,0.1576888888888889,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Positive,Neutral,Somewhat Positive

The chipmaker is well placed to take advantage of the sharp growth in 5G smartphone shipments thanks to its relationships with several major original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). That's why it wasn't surprising to see Qorvo crush Wall Street's estimates in Q2 of fiscal 2021 (ending on Oct. 3, 2020) and also provide terrific guidance for the current quarter.

Let's see what's working for Qorvo and why the chipmaker is capable of delivering more upside despite clocking gains over 100% over the past few months.

Qorvo delivers yet another solid report

Qorvo has been in fine form in recent quarters thanks to the increase in demand for 5G smartphone chips. The chipmaker generated $1.06 billion in revenue last quarter, a jump of more than 31% over the prior-year period. Non-GAAP net income shot up nearly 56% year over year to $282.3 million and adjusted earnings came in at $2.43 per share as compared to $1.52 a year ago. Its non-GAAP gross margin increased 5.2 percentage points year over year to 51.7%.

Qorvo attributed its impressive growth to a multitude of factors, including an increase in chip shipments to several top-tier smartphone suppliers, new content gains, and the commencement of GaN (gallium nitride) amplifier shipments for use in 5G base stations. According to CEO Bob Bruggeworth, ""Strength was diversified across customers and supported by multiyear technology upgrade cycles, including 5G and Wi-Fi 6. Customers are requiring more and better RF in highly integrated form factors to enable their next-generation products.""

This is not the first time Qorvo has said that 5G is driving content gains. The company had earlier pointed out that each 5G smartphone could add $5 to $7 worth of content to Qorvo's kitty. It reiterated that claim once again on the latest earnings conference call, stating that ""demand for 5G is adding RF complexity and driving higher content.""

The increased RF complexity in 5G smartphones is also triggering a ""shift from discrete products to higher-value content including integrated modules in flagship and mass-market 5G smartphones."" This is great news for Qorvo, as it gets around 71% of its total revenue from selling mobile chips, and that business is unlikely to lose steam anytime soon thanks to customers like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung.

The mobile business brought in higher-than-anticipated revenue for Qorvo last quarter as Apple ramped up production of the iPhone 12 lineup. Though the chipmaker didn't point this out explicitly, it did say that ""seasonal demand effects and the ramp of 5G smartphones"" were key to the outperformance of the mobile business. With Apple reportedly accounting for a third of Qorvo's total revenue, the chipmaker was bound to get a shot in the arm.

Apple is reportedly looking to increase the production of the iPhone 12 to a range of 80 million to 85 million units this year as per third-party estimates. According to another estimate, as many as 230 million to 240 million iPhone 12 units could be shipped in 2021. This could pave the way for Qorvo to clock high growth rates in the coming quarters. Apple iPhone shipments have plateaued in recent years, but the iPhone 12 could help it regain its mojo.

More importantly, the emergence of 5G smartphones could be a multiyear catalyst for Qorvo because the shift to the new networking standard is likely to drive secular shipment growth.

Why Qorvo is still a good buy

Shares of Qorvo have nearly doubled since the end of March, but it continues to remain a solid bet for investors looking for a growth stock. The company's fiscal Q3 guidance points toward big gains once again. It anticipates $1.06 billion in revenue during the quarter ending in December, along with an adjusted gross margin of 52.5% and earnings of $2.65 per share.

The projections show substantial growth over the prior-year period's revenue of $869 million, non-GAAP gross margin of 49.3%, and earnings of $1.86 per share. Analyst estimates compiled by Yahoo! Finance predict that Qorvo could continue delivering high earnings growth rates in the future, and that looks likely considering the secular catalyst it enjoys in the form of 5G smartphone adoption.

Given that Qorvo stock trades at just 18 times forward earnings, it isn't too late for investors looking to buy a 5G stock right now, as it may have room to run higher.",microsoft,msft,"[{'neg': 0.228, 'neu': 0.772, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5023}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.753, 'pos': 0.247, 'compound': 0.3182}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.753, 'pos': 0.247, 'compound': 0.3182}]",0.1591,-0.5023,0.1591,-0.06136666666666665,Somewhat Negative,Somewhat Positive,Negative,Somewhat Positive
