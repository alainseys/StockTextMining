Why You Should Be Buying This Tech Stock in November,Motley Fool,6 days ago,"The chipmaker reportedly gets a substantial chunk of its revenue from Apple, and its largest customer supplied 21% of the total revenue last quarter. Synaptics' ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/12/why-you-should-be-buying-this-tech-stock-november/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Synaptics (NASDAQ:SYNA) has beaten the broader stock market handsomely over the past year thanks to its shift to a higher-margin business model, and it looks like the shares have more upside to offer given the company's latest quarterly results.

The chipmaker's fiscal 2021 first-quarter earnings jumped significantly over the prior-year period on the back of strong momentum across the PC, mobile, and the Internet of Things (IoT) businesses. Synaptics exceeded its own expectations last quarter, and claims to have a nice pipeline of design wins and new product ramps that could help it move into a higher gear in this new fiscal year.

Let's see why Synaptics could remain a top tech stock and sustain its impressive rally.

Synaptics is making the right moves

Synaptics' fiscal first-quarter revenue came in at $328.4 million, down 3% over the prior-year period but higher than the midpoint of the company's guidance range of $315 million to $335 million. The lower revenue was because Synaptics' now-divested TDDI (touch and display driver integration) business was a part of the mobile segment in the year-ago quarter.

The liquid-crystal display (LCD) TDDI business generated $131 million in revenue in the first half of fiscal 2020 (about $65 million per quarter). So investors shouldn't be worried about the company's revenue decline, as it managed to substantially improve its margin profile thanks to the divestment.

Synaptics reported non-GAAP gross margin of 49.7% in the previous quarter, a huge jump over the prior-year period's figure of 41.5% and the highest level it has seen in over seven years. The company also clocked its highest operating margin in over six years. The margin gains translated into a nice earnings bump, with Synaptics reporting adjusted earnings of $1.85 per share, compared to $1.22 per share in the year-ago quarter.

The company is expected to enjoy strong earnings growth through the new fiscal year thanks to the divestment of the TDDI business and its focus on the higher-margin organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display driver segment. Rosenblatt Securities estimates that the sale of the TDDI business could boost Synaptics' earnings by $0.45 to $0.55 per share in fiscal 2021.

Major catalysts ahead

Synaptics' mobile business supplied 40% of its total revenue last quarter, and it is playing a key role in driving up its margins as the smartphone market shifts from LCDs to OLEDs. The company anticipates 10 new smartphones equipped with its OLED touch controllers to hit the market in the coming months, though it may have a huge winner on its hands in the form of the new Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 12 models.

Synaptics management pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that:

We also had our major handset OEM [original equipment manufacturer] announce their new flagship phones last month powered by our OLED touch controller.

The chipmaker reportedly gets a substantial chunk of its revenue from Apple, and its largest customer supplied 21% of the total revenue last quarter. Synaptics' mobile revenue shot up 25% year over year after adjusting for the sale of the TDDI business, and it is likely to sustain its momentum given reports that Apple is preparing to increase production and ship over 200 million units next year. The new iPhones could drive a mega upgrade cycle for Apple, and Synaptics could ride on the smartphone giant's coattails.

Looking beyond mobile, Synaptics is turning up the heat in the IoT business. The segment accounted for 35% of Synaptics' revenue last quarter, and it is expected to exceed the mobile business in size in the fiscal second quarter. The IoT business is benefiting from a broad range of growth trends in video interface solutions, audio chips, and smart homes.

With the IoT chip market expected to clock double-digit growth rates in the coming years, according to third-party estimates, it isn't surprising to see why Synaptics sees better days ahead in this business. So, investors who have been on the sidelines so far should take a closer look at Synaptics, as it has the ingredients to keep growing at a nice clip.

Finally, Synaptics trades at an attractive valuation. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24 is way lower than the five-year average multiple of 94. Meanwhile, a forward P/E ratio of 14.6 points toward future earnings growth, which Synaptics should be able to deliver given the catalysts it is sitting on.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.927, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.2023}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.927, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.2023}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.10115,0.0,0.10115,0.06743333333333333,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Positive,Neutral,Somewhat Positive
2 Cheap Dividend Stocks You Can Buy Right Now,Motley Fool,6 days ago,"Broadcom also generated a fifth of its revenues from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) last year, so it should benefit from robust sales of the iPhone 12 over the next few ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/12/2-cheap-dividend-stocks-you-can-buy-right-now/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","With the Nasdaq hovering near all-time highs, many tech stocks can't be considered cheap. Most high-growth tech companies also don't pay dividends, since they usually reinvest their cash into their expanding businesses.

But for investors who favor stability and income over high-risk growth, there are still plenty of tech stocks that pay high dividends and trade at low valuations. Let's take a closer look at two companies that fit that description: Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and IBM (NYSE:IBM).

1. Broadcom

Broadcom sells a wide range of chips for the data center, networking hardware, storage, broadband, wireless, and industrial markets. It also expanded into the infrastructure software market with its acquisitions of CA Technologies in 2018 and Symantec's security business in 2019.

Broadcom's stock rallied about 20% this year as the strength of its infrastructure software unit offset the pandemic-related disruptions of its semiconductor business. Its total revenue rose 4% year over year in the first nine months of 2020, but its adjusted EPS dipped 1% -- mainly due to the costs of integrating Symantec's security business.

Broadcom's sales of networking and broadband chips also stabilized sequentially in the second and third quarters, as cloud and telecom customers upgraded their infrastructure to address the surge in online activity throughout the pandemic. Analysts currently expect Broadcom's revenue and earnings to rise 6% and 3%, respectively, for the full year.

But looking into 2021, analysts expect Broadcom's revenue and earnings to rise 9% and 16%, respectively, as the pandemic passes and the expanding 5G and cloud markets lift sales of its networking and wireless chips. Broadcom also generated a fifth of its revenues from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) last year, so it should benefit from robust sales of the iPhone 12 over the next few quarters.

Broadcom has a well-diversified business, a wide moat, and its stock trades at just 15 times forward earnings. It currently pays a forward dividend yield of 3.4%, and it plans to spend about half of its free cash flow (FCF) on dividends every year. It spent 48% of its FCF on its dividend over the past 12 months -- which indicates its dividend remains rock-solid even as other companies cut or suspend their payouts.

2. IBM

IBM became a Dividend Aristocrat of the S&P 500 earlier this year after raising its dividend for the 25th straight year. Unfortunately, joining that elite group didn't prevent IBM's stock from dropping 14% this year as investors lost patience with its sluggish turnaround efforts.

But three significant things recently happened at IBM. First, IBM acquired the open source software provider Red Hat in July 2019. That acquisition expanded its hybrid cloud business, which allows companies to store their data on both public cloud platforms and on-site private clouds.

Second, Arvind Krishna, IBM's cloud and cognitive solutions chief, succeeded Ginni Rometty as its new CEO in April and immediately focused on expanding its higher-growth cloud businesses.

Lastly, Krishna recently revealed IBM would spin off its slow-growth IT services segment into a new company that prioritizes the growth of its hybrid cloud and AI businesses. That spin-off won't happen until late 2021, but it indicates IBM is finally streamlining its sprawling business and focusing on growing its revenue again.

For now, IBM's growth looks anemic. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to decline 4% and 34%, respectively, this year, as the ongoing pandemic throttles the growth of most of its non-cloud businesses.

But looking ahead into 2021, analysts expect IBM's revenue and earnings to rise 1% and 38%, respectively, as the pandemic passes. After IBM spins off its IT services segment, which constantly erases the growth of its cloud-based businesses, its growth should accelerate significantly in 2022 and beyond.

IBM's stock won't blast off anytime soon, but it trades at just 10 times forward earnings and pays a meaty forward dividend yield of 5.7%. It's unclear if the ""new"" IBM will remain a Dividend Aristocrat after its upcoming split, but the company has said that both new companies will pay a combined quarterly dividend that is ""no less"" than IBM's current dividend.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.173, 'compound': 0.6872}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.173, 'compound': 0.6872}]",0.6872,0.0,0.6872,0.45813333333333334,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive
Is Now a Good Time to Build an ESG Portfolio?,Motley Fool,6 days ago,"The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft and recommends the following options: long January 2021 $85 calls on Microsoft, ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/esg-investing/2020/11/12/is-now-a-good-time-to-build-an-esg-portfolio/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","The financial community has been abuzz about ESG funds, which have shown a surprising level of strength in recent years. And now, with a President-elect who supports sustainability waiting in the wings, the time could be right to build out a broader ESG portfolio -- as long as you understand the risks.

A bright ESG outlook

It wasn't too long ago that you didn't have the option to build a well-diversified ESG portfolio. You might have held a clean energy fund out of principle, but you also had to own positions that rated lower on ESG factors just to have a sufficient level of diversification.

Not so today. The ESG fund space has grown dramatically in recent years to the point that it may check all the boxes on your portfolio's target asset allocations -- including emerging markets, international developed markets, domestic large and mid caps, real estate, and domestic and international fixed income.

And now, with President-elect Joe Biden on his way to the White House, ESG investing will likely continue to flourish as it benefits from a more favorable regulatory environment going forward. As a starting point, Biden is expected to rejoin the Paris climate deal and reenact federal initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. More than that, Biden and running mate Kamala Harris are also likely to enact policies that go beyond the ""E"" in ESG, policies that encourage responsible corporate social and governance practices as well.

What happens next

While analysts largely agree that ESG funds will do well under a Biden-Harris administration, there's always the question of what happens next. Yes, Biden and Harris will likely swing the regulatory pendulum to support sustainability. But that pendulum could very well swing back the other way in four or eight years. It could even happen at the hands of Donald Trump, who's rumored to be considering a run at the 2024 election.

If you are investing for the long haul, it's always risky to overhaul your portfolio based on a four-year window of opportunity. Once you start making investing decisions based on who's in the White House, it becomes difficult to stop. You could find yourself in a perpetual state of trying to predict what will happen under this administration or the next. That's not a good place to be, emotionally or financially. You'll end up riding a stress rollercoaster every four years and, if you act on your predictions, you might inadvertently lower your investment returns, too.

Take a measured approach

If sustainability is important to you, it's appropriate to increase your exposure to companies with strong ESG initiatives and track records, either directly or through ESG funds, with a caveat. You're not making these moves as a strategy to get rich while Biden is president -- you're making them because they're right for you long term. You can stick to the long-term approach by remaining disciplined about how you choose your ESG positions.

When selecting individual stocks, for example, evaluate the business model, leadership team, industry dynamics, financial strength, and cash flow, in addition to the ESG ratings.

To evaluate ESG funds, take care to understand the fund's screening process. The presence of ESG, clean energy, or sustainability in the fund's name doesn't mean much. Dig in and find out how companies are selected for the portfolio. Review the holdings carefully, too, to ensure you aren't overexposed to companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. These are popular in both ESG and traditional funds. Check the fund's performance history and also put your eyes on the expense ratio. Expenses for ESG funds can be on the high side relative to traditional funds.

Finally, don't overlook diversification. Focusing your investing on the ESG space naturally limits your diversification. That's not to say you should invest in ExxonMobil to counter that, but just make sure your holdings are spread appropriately across individual companies, asset classes, and even geographies.

Focus on the long term

Building out a broader ESG portfolio may be the right move from the standpoint of your worldview and values. Make sure it's also the right financial move by staying diversified and also disciplined in your selection process. You certainly want to benefit from ESG investing in the short term, but your decisions have to make long-term sense, too.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.756, 'pos': 0.244, 'compound': 0.4404}]","[{'neg': 0.095, 'neu': 0.654, 'pos': 0.252, 'compound': 0.4215}]","[{'neg': 0.095, 'neu': 0.654, 'pos': 0.252, 'compound': 0.4215}]",0.4215,0.4404,0.4215,0.42779999999999996,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive

This video was recorded on Nov. 9, 2020.

Chris Hill: It's Monday, November 9th. Welcome to MarketFoolery. I'm Chris Hill, with me today, Mr. Bill Barker. Thanks for being here.

Bill Barker: Thanks for having me.

Hill: It is a big day in the market. You know, it was already looking good Sunday night, the Dow futures were up on the news that, in case you missed it, while votes are still being counted, Joe Biden will become the 46th President of the United States. And that was Sunday night, things were looking good, and this morning [laughs] we got the news that Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, which is in Phase III trials is more than 90% effective in participants who were not previously infected. And I suppose that should be expected, that news has set off all kinds of ripple effects [laughs] across the market. The S&P 500 hit a new high this morning. Airline stocks, hotel and travel stocks, cruise lines, theme parks all up more than 10%. We're going to get to the stay-at-home stocks in a minute, but what do you see, like, what goes through your mind when you see all of these categories of stocks, broadly, as a group rising at once?

Barker: The first thing you see is a lot of stuff that's up dramatically today and then you need to go back and see how they've done over the whole course of the year, and to be reminded that up 20% today doesn't mean these things are close to, in some cases, getting back to where they started the year at before COVID was there. So, in terms of a quick snapshot, it may look like there's some overreaction, but in the longer term, I don't think so.

Hill: Just one of those stocks that I think fits that category of what you just described is AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), which is the largest movie theater chain in the world. Shares are up 60% today. And you look at that and you think, oh, my goodness! And then you, as you indicated, you sort of back out a little bit and you say, oh, it's still down 50% for the year, which [laughs] in a normal year you'd think, oh, my goodness! What is happening to this stock?

Some of these moves, however, seem not crazy to me, they seem reasonable. Marriott, in particular, Marriott is just one of those hotel operators that has been, I don't know, I just sort of look at Marriott and even three months ago I thought to myself, I'm pretty sure Marriott is coming out of this OK on the other side, because at some point we get the vaccine. So, some of what I'm seeing in hotel and travel, Booking Holdings, Expedia, you know, the rise that we're seeing in those shares today makes sense to me.

The cruise lines, and I don't mean to pick on the cruise lines, but the cruise lines I'm less bullish on those as businesses than I am the airlines.

Barker: Okay, yeah. Well, they are less critical than the airlines. Now, unlike some of these things, I don't see the obvious competition over the long term to what cruises offer, i.e., the movie theater chains, and we've talked about this, there's really significant competition from what you can experience at home, the better, larger, clearer TV sets. The extremely good value proposition of what you're getting from something like Netflix versus going out to a movie theater and seeing one movie, especially, in a family. So, I think that AMC has, sort of, gotten partially up off of the floor, having been left for dead, it's got its last gasp, maybe better than that, maybe not, today. But you see where the competition is and has been for several years, and this sped things up, but the fact that it looks very good today that we'll have a vaccine and people will be able to go to theaters, doesn't change maybe the next 10-year trajectory for them.

Cruises, I would say, I don't see how they're going to be Netflix out of existence. Airlines, of course, are necessary, fundamental, don't have a great history of return to shareholders but certainly as soon as it is safe in everybody's mind to fly again, they're going to start flying, both to catch up on all the vacations that they wanted to be taking right now. I think a lot of work travel is going to go away to a degree that, you know, Zoom has replaced the need for a lot of that face-to-face stuff. So, different long-term projections, of course, for every single one of these industries, but they're all back to life today.

Hill: One more group that we haven't mentioned yet that's back to life, at least in terms of the stocks, mall-based retail, Macy's, Nordstrom, Kohl's, all up more than 10% today. Simon Property Group is going to report after the bell today, and the last time I looked this morning, the stock was up 20%.

Barker: This is not going to come fast enough to save a mall-based Christmas, i.e., the timeline for people actually having a vaccine under the best-case scenario, in large numbers, is going to be the second quarter of next year. But there will be a time in the middle of next year where I think that malls see significantly more traffic than they're seeing today. Again, I think it just falls into, hey, how was the future looking for malls 12 months ago? Not great. You know, more and more purchases are going online. That sped up. Malls will get to have a second act once people are gathering in large numbers indoors again, but the competition over the longer timeframe still you got to say malls have got a lot, a lot of competition coming at them.

Hill: On the flipside, some of the stay-at-home stocks, the ripple effect for them is, of course, a negative one, Zoom Video, Peloton, just two of the stocks down more than 10% today. Although, you know, I feel like the same thing is true just in the opposite form [laughs] of what you said, where it's like, OK, I get that Peloton and Zoom Video have had really good runs in 2020. I suppose, if I were a short-term trader, maybe I'll be making this trade too, do we really feel like the future for these two businesses is significantly darker than it was a day ago? I don't know, like, on some level, part of me looks at everything that's happening today and I'm not doing any transacting today, but one of my thoughts is, hey, everybody seems to be acting like it's a big surprise that there's a vaccine. It's like, didn't we all know they were working on a vaccine? Like, we knew this day was coming at some point, didn't we?

Barker: Yeah, we did know something was coming. And look, the data that is out so far today, and it's still incomplete, but it is better than even the optimists were hoping for in terms of 90%, better than 90%, they're actually rounding down to 90%, Pfizer is, from what I understand, based on not wanting to oversell this. So, it's maybe even beyond the high-end of what you could have optimistically been hoping for. The timeline was basically, comfortably in the optimistic, but realistic timeline. And there still may be some pickups in between now and when this all really goes away.

Look, there was the premarket 300 Dow point-ish Biden Presidency move that was expected, as of premarket late-last night. And then this is both the optimistic stuff we were hoping for, and the better than optimistic. So, it's all good today, isn't it?

Hill: Ironically though, shares of Pfizer up 5%, 6%. [laughs]

Barker: Sleepy year, get to work, guys, get to work, do something. [laughs] This stock has been flat for the year. It was $39.20 at the close of 2019, it's $39.70, $39.80, $39.90, something like that at the moment. Come on! What do you... get to work. [laughs]

Hill: [laughs] You're chastising people at Pfizer.

Barker: [laughs] Well, this is the problem. This is the problem with extracting stories from stock moves, at times, it's phenomenal work. They're taking cautious victory laps out there today, very thrilled with the data that they have in hand right now, while continuing to say that there are additional steps, and these are necessary and that the process is the way it is to, you know, have the safe outcomes that we expect out of our healthcare system. So, a great year for actual performance in terms of the stock, you know, it's not your best-performing stock [laughs] this year, but the stuff that is the best-performing stuff this year is having the weakest day today.

Hill: Let's move on to some of the earnings news. Shares of McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) hovering in the +1% or -1% today. McDonald's had a good third quarter report, profits were higher than expected, revenue looked good, same-store sales in the United States were up a little more than 4.5%. Not that I thought that these results were going to set the stock on fire, but I thought there'd be -- you know, this coupled with the news of the vaccine, I thought we'd see a little bit more boost in McDonald's shares this morning.

Barker: Well, yeah, maybe give it a little bit more than a day, as people are getting more excited about buying up the stuff that had been beaten down much more than McDonald's had been. So, in terms of, let's go value shopping today, it's not attracting quite the same amount of interest. But, yeah, very normal looking numbers. If this was a report that came out and you had not been around for any of 2020. So, you know, comps 4.6% in the U.S., weaker globally, but earnings pretty good. All the numbers, all the percentages, up-or-down look comfortably in what you're used to seeing in other contexts. It's not the +120% growth that most COVID-benefited stocks have seen. It's not -30% as some of the second quarter results were for some industries. So, longer term, the only interesting thing here is the McPlant news.

Hill: I was going to say, if there's not a big reaction in McDonald's shares, shares of Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) falling close to 10% this morning on the news that in 2021 McDonald's is coming out with a plant-based burger of their own.

Barker: Have you had any of these plant-based burgers?

Hill: Not burgers, no, I had the Dunkin' breakfast sandwich, the beyond sandwich.

Barker: Are you a buyer?

Hill: Well, I bought that one time. [laughs]

Barker: [laughs] Well, they've continued to offer it, have they not?

Hill: They have continued to offer it. I think I may have said on the show before that the problem -- so, the Beyond Sausage in the breakfast sandwich at Dunkin', very good, very tasty, good texture, like, pretty much everything I'm looking for [laughs] out of that ingredient. It was the rest of it, it was on this English muffin which was one of those things that reminds people like me that Dunkin' is really good at donuts, but when it comes to other bread-based, sort of, flour-based breakfast pastries and sandwiches that kind of think, yeah, they're not good with English muffins or the bagels, so. But the Beyond Sausage was good.

Barker: Throw that plant-based sausage between a couple of donuts, is that what you're saying, start with that one?

Hill: I'm saying, like, run out to the grocery store just [laughs] buy some English muffins and just let someone else do the work.

Barker: Well so, getting back to McDonald's, obviously, they've got an enormous base of sales that they're going to be able to deliver. And if they're producing their own McPlant, and not either requiring the ingredients from Beyond, and now offering a competition to Beyond, and ultimately maybe providing some of that to others. Yeah, not great news for beyond, although they've had a pretty good time of it, so it's their turn to get a little bit of a, you know, decline in their price.

Hill: Last Friday after the market closed, Berkshire Hathaway released its third quarter report. And for the second quarter in a row the headline is, Warren Buffett buying back his own stock. This time it was a record $9 billion worth of shares. And Berkshire Hathaway, that stock up 5%, 6% today.

Barker: Yeah, up 5%, 6%, like a lot of other things. So, I think buying back the shares, that comes out at a good time, but another, sort of, weak-ish year for the stock. They are going into the day, down almost 8%, so this gets you back to close to where the year started and underperforming the S&P, obviously, as it has for several years. They've got a lot of old economy industries in the conglomerate, and those are going to wake back up quite a bit more in a COVID vaccine era, but still there's not that terribly much to get excited about here. It's going to look more like the S&P 500 than not at most times.

Hill: Let me ask you a completely unfair question. [laughs] Do you think that Warren Buffett's lieutenants left to their own devices, and I know they have their own portfolios, but like, if they basically had complete control, do you think they're doing more buying of other stocks in the past three months than what we just saw from Buffett and Charlie Munger?

I know it's an unfair question, I'm asking you to speculate in a manner that is completely unreasonable, and yet, I asked it anyway.

Barker: Yeah. So, I agree with you that it's unfair and that any answer that I would give [laughs] is probably worthless. That said, I would hope so, right? I would hope that the guys that they've got in are looking at things with different eyes than Munger and Buffett. And that they have found people whose skills complement Buffett and Munger, because they've got their routines down, and Buffett's evolved somewhat, you know, having made the major purchases of Apple that he's made. But you would hope that they're not looking for clones of what they themselves have perfected in a different era.

Hill: All right. Let me ask you a much more reasonable and fair question, have you had any plant-based burgers? Like, I'm just trying to think ahead to 2021, you know, if I really wanted to go out of my way, I could find a Burger King and buy an Impossible Whopper or something like that, like, I don't know, I realize that people like me are the market and I'm not interested, but I'm curious if you've ever gone down this road before?

Barker: No. I mean, it's not something that I've taken a stand against, it's just never, and I see more and more of that choice in the grocery store next to the stuff that I'm actually buying. So, it's in eyesight more and more, and I'm sure I will try it within the next year or two. Why not? It might be good and it's probably going to be better in the near future than it is today. I haven't ever heard anybody tell me, oh, my God! You got to try this, it's just as good, right? Nobody has ever said that to me. And at the point at which that occurs, I might go full in. Because if I were allowed to eat all of the red meat that I want to eat, [laughs] well, I probably wouldn't be around for very long, so there's that. So, I'm hoping that there's a reason for me to hear that this is phenomenal and I have to eat all the plant-based burgers that I can, because I'll be there.

Hill: You and I have said this to one another for years that at some point down the road if the doctor comes to either one of us and says, you know, I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do at this point, you have three to six months and that's going to be it and we'll try to make you as comfortable as possible. One of our reactions is going to be, well, OK, [laughs] it's time to eat all the bacon I can get my hands on. And I bring this up because of the passing of someone who has been in our homes for +30 years and was a delight, and that's Alex Trebek, the passing of Alex Trebek. And if anyone missed any of the tributes over the weekend on social media or obituaries, just one of those things that reaffirms my faith in humanity, one of those, like, oh, he appears to be every bit as good a person by all accounts as was projected on the television screen. Although, among other things, it did give me the opportunity to explain to my teenagers the Saturday Night Live version of Jeopardy! where Alex Trebek, when it was Celebrity Jeopardy, he was just tolerating, just barely hanging on, Will Ferrell, [laughs] as Alex Trebek just tolerating really, really dumb guests, Burt Reynolds, Sean Connery and others.

Barker: Sean Connery also having passed in the last week or week-and-a-half, whatever it is now that -- yeah, I saw somebody connect those two dots on a Twitter post. And it is something that all children should be exposed to, the Saturday Night Live Jeopardy! and the Black Jeopardy! that they've done more recently, which is also a good comedy. And Trebek, yeah, people were falling all over themselves to bring up stories, if they had them, of personal interactions with him or knowledge of things that he had done or the effects that he had had on their lives. So, it was really nice to see that kind of universal acclaim for not just his work but his life.

Hill: Hopefully he, you know, just thought of Warren Zevon whose advice in the [laughs] last days of his life was to enjoy every sandwich. [laughs] So, hopefully Alex got to do that down the homestretch. Boy! This is a melancholy way to end the show. Sorry about that.

Barker: Yeah, go back to stock prices, they're up a billion points right now. [laughs] Everybody who own stocks is phenomenally happy at things, and many, many, many, many people are happy with the election results, including the market, which got, I think, the seemingly Republican Senate element of the outcome of the election, still to be determined by the runoffs in Georgia, but the odds are favorable that it'll either be a Republican majority. Even if it were to be a 50:50 split, I don't think that that would be the kind of mandate where the corporate tax increase that was part of the Biden tax proposal could really be likely pulled off. So, that's something that the market is kind of wallowing in as well today.

Hill: Well. And to go back to the stocks for a second, I mean, this is why we constantly talk about having a diversified portfolio, because if you've got Zoom Video in your portfolio and Peloton, and you also have Disney and Starbucks, it's like, all right, there have been points during the year where Peloton and Zoom Video were carrying the day for you, today it's the reverse, it's Disney and Starbucks that are boosting your portfolio, while stocks like Zoom Video on Peloton take a little bit of a haircut. But again, all the more reason to diversify as much as you can.

Barker: Yeah. No, it's a good day for value investors, and they have not had terribly many of them this year. But if you look at the, sort of, style box chart of returns, small caps is I think the first new high for Russell 2000, the best-known small cap index, in over two years. And so, you know, the number of new highs last year and this year for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 is out of all proportion to the rest of the market. And that's nice that small cap investors have finally got their money back, if they put something down in August of 2018 there, they're back to even.

Hill: Bill Barker, always good talking to you. Thanks for being here.

Barker: Thanks for having me.

Hill: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

Jason Moser: It's Monday, November 9th. I'm your host Jason Moser. On this week's Financial show, we're going to dig into the news of some very encouraging vaccine results and how that could potentially impact our world of financials related stocks. We've got a few earnings reports to dig into, we've also got our ones to watch for the coming week. Joining me this week, as most weeks, glad to have him as always, Certified Financial Planner, Mr. Matt Frankel. Matt, how's everything going?

Matt Frankel: Well, pretty much every stock that I've ever mentioned on the show is up by more than 10% today, so I'm having a pretty good morning, I don't know about you.

Moser: [laughs] Yeah. Hey, listen, you know, I don't let the stock market dictate my attitude, but it's certainly nice when you see them go up, I mean, you don't see --

Frankel: I don't either, but today might be an exception. [laughs]

Moser: We're seeing certainly some of them are going down, and we'll get into that, the whole stay-at-home stock phenomenon and how that's playing out. That will be just one part of our broader discussion here, but you know, let's go ahead and jump into this discussion, because clearly the big news of the day, the drugmakers Pfizer and BioNTech have indicated that their COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective.

Now, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves here. This could mean a lot of different things, but it really does seem, at the very core, it marks a major step in the right direction in this battle against COVID-19. And clearly, Wall Street is loving the news. Stocks across the board are feeling pretty good today, with the exception of the stay-at-home stocks; of course, we'll get to those.

But, Matt, one area of the market where we're seeing a big reaction, and it's something we talk a lot about here on the show, it's in Real Estate Investment Trusts, those REITs that we talk about a lot. Talk to us a little bit about why you think that the REIT segment of the market is receiving this news so positively?

Frankel: You got to remember there are many different subsectors of REITs that have kind of different, you know, dynamics here. So, there are some stay-at-home REITs, like, think of the data center REITs and things like that, and they're, kind of, not doing that great today. But most REITs own commercial properties that depend on people being able and willing to go places. So, when you look at just some of these numbers, and these were at 12:30, so they might have changed [laughs] by the time you are hearing this. Just some of the favorite ones we talk about on here, Empire State, the company that owns the Empire State Building, is up 30% today. Tanger Outlets that we talk about, they're up 23% today. Simon Property Group, the biggest mall REIT is up 26%. EPR Properties, about half of its portfolio is movie theaters, is up 41% today alone.

Moser: Yeah, that was the one I wanted to talk with you a little bit more about, I'll let you finish, but EPR that was one that struck me as standing out.

Frankel: Yeah. Welltower, which is healthcare REIT that owns a lot of senior housing -- which for obvious reasons, that hasn't been doing well -- is up 17% today. And last one, a lot of people are worried that people are going to leave cities if this pandemic keeps going, and AvalonBay, the big apartment REIT that owns a lot of urban apartment buildings, is up 12% today. So, across the board with all the, kind of, reopening REITs are doing phenomenally well today.

Moser: Yeah. And you're talking about people leaving the cities, you're talking about, sort of, that bigger picture idea that with going more toward a remote workforce or at least companies adopting the mindset that their employees can work offsite, perhaps permanently in many cases, I mean, that's going to maybe reduce the demand for living in these big cities. You talk about moving out toward the suburbs, and it sounds like apartment complex REITs, like the one you mentioned, that's got to be the reason for the optimism, I assume.

Frankel: Well, for sure. And also, take it with a grain of salt, because these are some of the most beaten down stocks during the pandemic. When I mentioned EPR, they're still roughly less than half of what they were trading for before the pandemic, even after today. So, a lot of these are really beaten down. And AvalonBay, the apartment one, I'm not saying there's going to be no remote work trend that prompts people to leave cities, but the stock is down 40% year-to-date, and the vacancy rate increased by 3%. So, that kind of just seems like it's not balanced correctly.

Moser: Yeah, it doesn't, you're right. And it's always worth remembering too, when we see headlines like this, because this is a headline we woke up to this morning, all across the country you could tell, I mean, there was plenty of excitement out there, because this is the news that you want to hear, right? This is not the magic bullet, so to speak, but this is definitely the news that you want to hear. It always strikes me too -- and I'm not trying to take the glass half empty perspective here, but when you see this type of reaction, it's always worth remembering, this isn't over, right? I mean, this marks a big step forward, but we're not through this yet. So, we still have a full Winter here, really, to go through.

And it feels like, let's try to temper everybody's expectations, you know, get questions throughout the morning on should I be buying these stocks or selling these stocks. And it's like, you know what, oftentimes, for investors, it's better to maybe take news like this, digest it through the course of the day, give yourself some time to think about things, the implications here, because it really, kind of, feels like this is great news. But there's most certainly going to be another bad headline at some point here in the next week, two weeks, one month, whatever it may be. So, it's always worth remembering, listen, this doesn't just mean everything is back to normal and everything is hunky-dory. I mean, this is good news, but we're not through this yet.

Frankel: Yeah, I mean, don't throw off your mask and run out into the streets to play just yet. But having said that, this was definitely good news, but this is going to take some time to really roll out. At a minimum, Pfizer said they will be ready to submit for emergency approval by the end of this month if everything goes well, that's two weeks after they have all their participants have gone through the trial for two months rather. After that, they're only going to make 50 million doses or so this year. So, even assuming they get all 50 million of those into people's arms by the end of this year, that's still roughly 80% of the U.S. population that is not going to be vaccinated. And then you have another few months, figure sometime in mid-2021, anyone who really needs a COVID vaccine will have one, so. And that's if things go well from here on. But this is definitely a step in the right direction, and these companies desperately needed some light at the end of the tunnel.

And another thing to mention is that a lot of this could be short covering that we're seeing today. You're seeing this spike. I mean, I looked right before we were on and some of the names I mentioned don't have a ton of short interest, but if you look at some of these numbers, they are just, kind of, off the charts. Tanger Outlets, for example, 51% of its shares are sold short right now. Seritage Growth Properties, 50% of its shares are sold short. EPR, it's over 10%. Almost 9% of Empire State Realty is sold short. So, you could see some of these, you know, people might be covering their shorts on this news too, which could be really fueling today's price action.

Moser: Yeah, and that's certainly not to take away from the gains that the stocks are seeing, but it's worth remembering, yeah, you said it, they've fallen a long way, short covering is what it is, but remember, that's not fundamentally really tied to the business. I mean, that's a short-term thing in nature anyway. And we're still really waiting for some form of stimulus package to come, hopefully sooner rather than later, because clearly, folks still need it, and it sounds like it's really just going to boil down to the President and the Senate negotiating some sort of a package there. I don't think it's really a matter of whether stimulus comes or not, it's really just a matter of how big the stimulus package really is.

So, let's pivot over and talk about that a little bit in regard to banks, because you see banks are another sector today that are really feeling the love. I'm looking at Bank of America here, for example. Right now, as we're recording the show, Bank of America shares are up 14%. I was looking at Ameris Bancorp (NASDAQ:ABCB) earlier, Ameris Bancorp up +20% today. So, you're seeing that covering everywhere from big banks to small banks and everywhere in between. This is interest rate related news, of course, but banks are going to benefit from positive economic news, I mean, they're going to benefit from a healthy economy, and if this is one step closer to a healthier economy then you can certainly understand the optimism in banks today as well.

Frankel: Right. Well, there's kind of two reasons you're seeing banks benefit from this. No. 1 is interest rates. This isn't interest rate specific news, but the 10-year Treasury soared to its highest level since March today. And so, that's kind of a forward-looking indicator that the economy is going to be healthier than people thought. You know, higher interest rates means higher profits for banks, but that's really not the main driving force. The main driving force is that there's a fear that there's going to be kind of a long-tailed uptick in loan losses, people can't afford to pay their bills, things like that, that's going to go on until this pandemic is over. And it's a well-founded fear, if you look at the numbers during the financial crisis when unemployment was elevated for a couple of years after the financial crisis, loan losses at some of these lenders stayed pretty high. So, there is that fear. And the sooner we can get back to business as usual, the sooner that fear goes away, and we're starting to see some of that today.

And if you look at some of the riskier consumer-facing lenders, you're seeing the gains are even higher, you mentioned Ameris, which is pretty much a consumer-facing bank. American Express is up 21% today, making our friend Warren Buffett a lot of money in the process.

Moser: [laughs] I mean, it's easy to forget, American Express is a bank. Yes, it's that credit card in your wallet, but it is technically a bank, and so it's beholden to all of those capital requirements and those rules and whatnot that your Bank of America and JPMorgans have to adhere to as well.

Frankel: They are the lender for -- if you use your AmEx Card, American Express is the company lending you money. So, if you run into trouble, you lose your job, something like that, and can't afford to pay it back, American Express is the one who gets left with an uncollectible debt. As the fears of that, kind of, start to go away, you're going to see those companies benefit. The more consumer-facing banks like Ameris, like, American Express. Wells Fargo, out of the big four, I think, was the biggest mover today, because it's a consumer-facing bank, not just an investment bank. And if you look at some of the investment banks, like Goldman Sachs, it's up by 7% today, which -- [laughs] the fact that it's up by 7% is, like, the worst gain in the sector, is pretty impressive. But that's because the investment banking businesses generally held up better during the pandemic, and you're seeing all these consumer-facing banks really pop because the experts are less fearful that you're going to see this long-tailed loan default wave come through.

Moser: And then you look even deeper into some of those numbers, and we've seen this over the past couple of quarters at least with a lot of these banks, the themes during a lot of these calls have really revolved around those loan loss reserves. These banks are reserving a lot of money, they're putting a lot of money aside for the potential for the possible losses that they could incur. If those losses don't materialize, or they don't materialize to the levels that those banks thought that they would. Well, that's a lot of money they put aside that is then going to be able to go, really, right back down the bottom-line for these banks at the end of the day.

Frankel: Yeah, they call that a reserve release, and you saw that a little bit in a few of the banks in the third quarter. You know, they were setting aside billions and billions of dollars in the first half of the year. And it turns out that the pandemic didn't turn out to a worst-case scenario economically, part of that was due to the CARES Act, part of that was due to just, I mean, it didn't continue to spiral out of control in March, it kind of leveled off after the shut downs and things like that. So, the economic impacts weren't a worst-case scenario.

2020 hasn't been a great economic year by any definition of the word, but we've definitely avoided a worst-case scenario. So, banks were able to release a little bit of their reserves, some banks, during the third quarter. If there is a widely available vaccine and the pandemic ends and, you know, unemployment already is under 7% in this country, if it falls back to pre-pandemic levels, which were in the 3% and 4% range, then you'll see a lot of these reserves come back and be released, and that turns into a big earnings boost for these banks. We saw that in the years following the financial crisis when they were finally allowed to release some reserves.

Moser: For sure. We're going to pivot into a little bit of a discussion here on the ""stay-at-home"" stocks, it's been a pretty unique phenomenon to 2020, I think, and an interesting one to discuss. And I guess to kick that discussion off, for me, really, it's interesting to see this disparity between four particular stocks. And if you look at MasterCard and Visa, for example. The market is rewarding those companies today, their stocks are doing very well. On the flip side of it, you look at Square and PayPal, those are companies where the stocks are actually selling off, and I think it's just interesting to note that, because we talk about this a lot, where MasterCard and Visa really -- I mean, at the end of the day, these aren't banks, they're not lenders, these are networks, these are toll booth models, they're really good proxies for the economy for consumer spending.

And if this is news that tells us that maybe the consumer is going to be able to come back a little bit more quickly, that things are going to start looking a little bit better, I can certainly understand why companies like MasterCard and Visa would be feeling some of the love today. But you flip it over, you look at PayPal and Square. PayPal and Square smaller companies, a little bit more diverse in what they do and what they offer. I wonder, perhaps some of the pullback on these stocks today is valuation related, they both had [laughs] really good years, but it seems like there would be something more to it. I mean, there's definitely the Square Capital side of the business. PayPal just chalked up a tremendous quarter, and again, it's had a tremendous year thus far. I wonder if those pull backs aren't just a little bit more valuation related than anything else.

Frankel: You got to think that Visa and MasterCard, they make the bulk of their money from a percentage of the transactions they process, they don't care whether those transactions are in-person or online, there might be a little difference in the pricing and the fees they make, but, you know, rise in consumer spending in any form is good for those companies. So, the fact that consumer spending is forecast to rise now, presumably because of a vaccine, is good for Visa and MasterCard just in general, it doesn't matter if people are doing e-commerce, if they're going out to the malls, things like that.

On PayPal especially, on the PayPal side of the equation, PayPal depends -- well, not just depends, but they benefit, specifically, from online spending. If you saw during the third quarter, PayPal added more subscribers, I think, than they ever have before, or their payment volume increased by more than it ever has before. And that's because people are -- for the most part -- I mean, we're venturing out a little bit to stores, but for the most part people are still staying home and shopping at home. And that's why Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) sales are still through the roof and things like that. So, PayPal benefits when people are spending money online.

Square, their core business is still in-person payment processing, but they are a fintech company, they're building out their online capabilities, the Cash App definitely does better in a stay-at-home environment for the time being at least, with what it has to offer. You know, person-to-person money transfers aren't happening in-person right now, so people are using things like the Cash App. And like you said, a lot of it could be valuation.

These have been some of the best-performing stocks, so I think today's news could have triggered a rotation from those high flying tech stocks into these value stocks that we've been talking about, the REITs and the banks, that are all of a sudden seeming like a better value, because, you know, from a risk/reward perspective.

Moser: Well, that's definitely understandable. I mean, I think we've all probably [laughs] been looking at the market this year, at least the second half of the year, and thinking, it's nice to see it doing so well. But yeah, valuations become more and more a concern. I think that you're right in that rotation point there, because we're not seeing necessarily any real discrimination here in the selling of a lot of these stay-at-home stocks. Amazon and Netflix being down, obviously Wayfair, these businesses are not going to stop doing what they're doing, right? These are businesses that are still very much going to be serving consumers in good times and in bad, so I think it's worth noting for investors. It's very easy to sit out there and talk about all the stay-at-home stock fad or whatever you might call it is over, but let's try to look a little bit beyond that. I mean, the stay-at-home stock concept on its own, I think, was a bit misguided and that was very short-term focused.

Stay-at-home isn't going to last forever, we knew that back at the beginning of the year. I would argue, if you're an analyst and you're surprised about what's happening today, you probably need to work on being a little bit of a better analyst. We've been seeing this and talking about it for a long time here, so this isn't a surprise. To me, the surprise would be, if folks were looking at a lot of these businesses and saying, oh, now their day in the sun is over. Amazon, Wayfair, Netflix, I mean, we don't need to worry about Etsy, another great example. It's not like people are going to stop shopping online, but there's a psychology behind some of this today.

Frankel: Yeah, for sure. No one thought this was going to last forever. The reason today's news is so significant is that it looks like it could be over sooner than we thought. And it's not just that this came sooner than we thought, we thought we were going to see some stage three trial data in November, but it looks like no one predicted a 90% effectiveness rating from the first vaccine candidate.

Moser: That was really encouraging. [laughs] Really encouraging news.

Frankel: And I don't know about you, but I've been reading, kind of, horror stories about the side effect potential of these vaccines. There was one article I read from some trial participants, I don't think it was in Pfizer's trial, where they said after the second shot, they were just on their bed for two days. So, it's not only 90% effective, but it's doing it without any significant side effects, which is, just on both sides, much better than anyone thought it would be.

So, no one thought it was lasting forever, but this is really giving them hope that the pandemic could actually become a thing of the past before too long, you know, we might not have to wear masks and I might be able to come see you in HQ before we thought it might happen.

Moser: Well, we will keep our fingers crossed. Like you said, there is plenty of work left to do, it does feel like this was really meaningful news today though; for a lot of reasons that you just noted right there. And so, you know, all we can do is, is continue to hope for the best. Of course, thank you to all of the brightest minds out there who are working so hard on our behalf to really help us, as not only as a country, but really as a world, as a global society to get past this, because it doesn't discriminate, you know, the virus, you can't stop it. Until you can actually come up with a vaccine, you can't do anything other than try to mitigate it and manage it, and that's what we've been doing at this point. But definitely good news. It seems like the market is receiving it very well.

By the same token, folks out there, don't let this just make you think that everything is hunky-dory and get back to normal, this is one more step in the right direction, but it sounds like there's still some work to do. We'll continue to follow it and we'll pay attention to the companies that matter to you most.

Speaking of the companies that matter to you most, Matt, let's drop this discussion for a few minutes and let's get into what happened last week, which was another slew of earnings. And we got to talk about all of these companies all week last week, we talked about some of them on Motley Fool Money last week as well. But there were a lot of companies in our space, the financial space, that reported earnings, and we want to get into them and talk a little bit about the quarters. We have a lot of them, so we're going to get to them, we've going to give them their due attention in quick fashion here.

But let's go ahead and start with, really, you know, this guy likes talking about elephant guns, let's talk about the elephant in the room here, Berkshire Hathaway. And I'll let you talk about this quarter, but I'll just tell you, I was amazed at how much stock they bought back.

Frankel: Yeah. And you just hit the nail on the head, that's the big headline, Berkshire bought back $9.3 billion worth of stock. I just wrote something about it on Fool.com today, because Berkshire actually takes it one step further than most companies and breaks down its purchases by month, by class of shares. So, whether it bought back the A. shares or the B shares, and the average price it paid per month.

So, remember that Berkshire can only buy back stock if Buffett and Charlie Munger both agree that it's trading cheaply at any given time. And the average purchase price in September, when they bought back the most stock out of that three-month period, was in the $216 range, which is even after today's move, is not that far from where it is now. So, that's them telling the market that even at that price, the stock was much cheaper than its intrinsic value and was a really good just investment in general.

Berkshire's operating businesses really didn't give us any big surprises. The company still has about $140 billion of cash even after that buyback that we just mentioned. And I am really looking forward to its 13-F coming out this weekend, because remember, we don't get to see what they did in their stock portfolio yet, they're going to release their 13-F filing, it's called, which they have to release 45 days after the quarter ends, which adds up to the 14 of the month. So, we'll see that soon.

We do know that Berkshire's cost basis in its stock portfolio went up by $9 billion during the quarter from this earnings report, and the only thing that we know they bought is about $2 billion of Bank of America stock. What's with that other $7 billion, what they buy is what I'm, kind of, curious about? [laughs]

Moser: [laughs] Yeah. Well, I feel like we'll be able to talk about that next week maybe. What do you think that disagreement between Buffett and Munger looks like? Whenever they're deliberating the intrinsic value of that stock and whether it's worth the repurchase, what do you think that disagrees ... do you think they ever really, like, vehemently just disagree with one another?

Frankel: Well, this quarter, it doesn't look like they disagreed much at all. [laughs] But in general, who would you say is the more conservative out of the two? I'd have to go with Munger.

Moser: Yeah, I think you're probably right. Yeah, I think that's right.

Frankel: So, they're both very conservative investors, which is why when they're buying back stock and sending the message that they think it's cheap, that's why I take it very, very seriously, because they're both very conservative investors. But I mean, I'm sure they do have their own little closed door, you know -- well, now they're doing it probably through Zoom, but they probably have an argument about what the company is really worth and all that. Obviously, they didn't argue too much this quarter, they bought back a whole lot of stock. That's almost 2% of the outstanding in one quarter, which is a pretty aggressive buyback.

Moser: That is aggressive. Well, you know, that tells you a lot right there, so that's worth keeping in mind, and we'll look forward to learning a little bit more about the equity moves here next week and beyond as well.

Matt, Square, not surprisingly, reported another very impressive quarter. It was one that I felt like, you know, after PayPal's quarter earlier in the week, it seemed like, you know, Square was set up to report some good numbers, and they didn't disappoint. There are a lot of numbers here that really make you feel like this business just continues to do a lot of good things. Total net revenue crossed the $3 billion mark, it was up 148% if you exclude Caviar, which they sold off a while back. What stood out to you in this most recent quarter for Square?

Frankel: Well, I've been following Square's brokerage efforts for a while, because I love the Cash App. The Cash App users doubled year-over-year, which is really impressive at this stage considering how big it is. The gross profit generated by the Cash App -- remember, we said a few times during the, kind of, earlier stages of monetization still, the gross profit generated by the Cash App nearly tripled year-over-year. Remember, they rolled out their stock trading feature on the Cash App, 2.5 million people had bought-and-sold stock on the Cash App as of the end of the third quarter. That's pretty impressive. I don't know the stats, but I'm sure when TD Ameritrade was invented, for example, they didn't get to 2.5 million that quick.

Moser: It's a lot. And they said billions of dollars have already been traded by the end of the third quarter. I saw that snippet and that was one that was something that really stood out to me as well.

Frankel: Yeah. And I mean, not only is their growth impressive, but it's accelerating. Over the past six, seven quarters, they've grown consistently at 30% to 40% year-over-year revenue pace, or I'm sorry, gross profit rather. Gross profit was up 63% this quarter, so not only are they still keeping their growth trajectory alive, but it's kind of like, it's going kind of parabolic right now. [laughs]

So, Square is pretty impressive. I bought Square a while ago, I never really envisioned it would turn into what it has, I just thought it was a really interesting payment processing platform, to be honest with you. And my only problem with Square is that I didn't buy more back in 2015 or whenever the IPO was.

Moser: [laughs] Yeah. Clearly, I have been a very happy shareholder as well; my daughters own shares, they feel pretty good about that. I can't say that I found, really, anything in the quarter that concerned me. One thing to note, and this is not a mark against them, as a matter of fact, I think I really actually credit them for this, they're going to ramp up investments in the business next year. Talking about 2021, they're talking about ramping up investments in the business around 40% from this year. And that will impact profitability to the extent that revenue growth is impacted. So, we want to pay attention to that topline. The investments in the business could certainly play out on profitability. Again, that seems like a short-term thing in order to ensure the longer term success of the business, but you know, you keep those types of things in mind, because a company that's going to spend like that, who knows what the psychology of the market is going to be in 2021, but maybe that opens up a window to add to that position if the chance arises.

Frankel: Yeah, for sure. I've considered pulling the trigger on some more Square for a long time, including in March when it was down in the $30s for a brief time, then I just got cold feet. I'm learning my lesson with Square over-and-over that, you know, keep adding to your winners. [laughs] One of these days I'll actually take my own advice and do it. When I can stop talking about it for a few days, because that also has to happen.

Moser: Yeah, that's one of our hurdles, but hopefully, listeners that are listening, taking your advice into consideration. Well, another one of our favorite payments companies here that reported last week, PayPal. You know, I mentioned that I wasn't surprised with Square's numbers, because PayPal had lobbed up such a great quarter earlier in the week.

And to your point there in regard to the user growth, the thing that stood out to me, and I went back a couple of calls to really confirm this, because when I saw what I saw on the release, I thought, wait a minute, what? Because that sounded like it was a much larger number than what they had initially guided for, and it was. If you go back to January of this year during the fourth quarter earnings call, management had set the target in that call for 2020 to add approximately 35 million net new active accounts. In this quarter three release, Matt, they upped that guidance. They now see adding 70 million net new active accounts for the year. So, essentially what's been going on all year long has more or less doubled the user growth that they had projected back at the beginning of the year. And to no one's surprise, they raised guidance pretty much across the board.

Frankel: Well, what's really standing out to me is, I wasn't surprised that they added a ton of users, say, in the second quarter when everything was shut down and people were only shopping online and that kind of thing. What really surprised me is they kept that momentum going into the third quarter, when for the most part, everything has reopened. So, they added over 15 million users in the third quarter alone, so I'm not surprised they raised their full-year guidance like that. And that they're keeping that momentum alive and, kind of, really building out their base even [laughs] when the economy is reopening. So, that really stood out to me.

Just a stat to show you just how big PayPal has gotten. They processed $247 billion of payments this quarter, that is almost $1 trillion of volume flowing through PayPal's system on an annual basis. That's about 10X what Square is doing, by the way. So, this is huge. And that's pretty much only online, they're not really in the brick-and-mortar space to a big extent.

Moser: Yeah, not to that extent. I mean, they added over 1.5 million merchants for the quarter; they now have 28 million total. The thing that I was really impressed with, Venmo continues to gain a lot of traction. 65 million users drove +$44 billion in total payment volume; that was up 61%. Forecasting $900 million in Venmo revenue in 2021, but the thing that really stood out to me was that Venmo, in 2021, will contribute positively to transaction margin dollars. So, we've been talking about this a lot, we've got listener questions in regard to Venmo on profitability. It sounds like 2021, where your profitable Venmo is, from what I could gather.

Frankel: Yeah. So, Venmo is obviously something Square doesn't have. I call that a big differentiator for PayPal. Just the Venmo and PayPal ecosystem is kind of ahead of where Square and Cash App is right now, I would call it. That may change. Square is trying to be a little different with its Cash App than PayPal is with Venmo. I mean, I don't think -- correct me if I'm wrong -- but I don't think PayPal has mentioned the need to, desire to put a stock trading platform on Venmo or to put bitcoin capability into it or anything like that ...

Moser: Yeah, not to my knowledge.

Frankel: So, it's two different animals. And PayPal, they're trying to build out the payment network. Square is trying to be, kind of, an all-in-one financial company for everybody. So, that's kind of the -- I mean, they can both coexist, they serve different use cases, and there's a lot of room for both of them to keep growing from this point. $1 trillion is not a ton when you think that the global card payment volume is in the $40 trillion to $50 trillion range. So, I mean, don't let that $1 trillion number scare you into thinking that PayPal has done growing.

Moser: Very good point, very good point. Yeah, I totally agree. It seems like there's still plenty of wide-open space ahead for both companies to capture. You know, another company that we talk about on the show here, and a company that I featured recently in the show when we talked about the stocks that we were going to buy next, Bill.com.

Bill.com reported for the quarter, and it was, again, another quarter of just what looked like impressive growth. Total revenue was $42.1 million, it was up 33% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. We saw a nice little bump up in gross margin thanks to the business scaling and more volume going through the system. They serve 98,000 customers at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, that was growth of 28%. Processed $25.4 billion in total payment volume on the platform in the quarter; that was up 26% from the year ago, and processed 5.6 million transactions for the quarter. At the end of the quarter they had 2.5 million network members; that was up almost 40% from the year ago.

So, again, for a business that's really focused on that small- to medium-sized business demographic and helping tighten up back office operations, eliminate paper, create more efficiencies using that artificial intelligence, as a shareholder in Bill.com I was certainly very encouraged by that quarter.

Speaking of businesses that we each follow pretty closely, Matt, Green Dot also announced earnings last week, tell me how that quarter went?

Frankel: Well, it was pretty good actually. Their revenue was up about 21% year-over-year, beating their own expectations. The primary driver of increasing revenue is, well, there's two actually, there's stimulus checks, which kind of prompted a whole lot, because they do prepaid debit cards. That's one of their big businesses; that prompted a whole lot of usage of those products. But their Banking-as-a-Service platform, which they let companies like Apple, and Intuit, and Uber use as, kind of, their banking network, because they are a chartered bank, unlike a lot of the fintechs we followed, let them use their infrastructure to offer their own banking products to their customers and employees. Like the feature that allows Uber drivers to instantly get paid is powered by Green Dot. So, that revenue was up.

And the real key thing to mention is that that's where you really want to see the growth momentum in Green Dot, because that's the higher margin of their revenue. So, that's growing, their margins are up, their margin expanded by 100 basis points year-over-year actually. The new CEO who took over a couple of quarters ago, Dan Henry, is doing a fantastic job. And I know everybody was rolling their eyes at me every time I mentioned Green Dot when it was down in the $20s earlier this year, and he's done a great job of turning the ship around since then and really focusing efforts on the Banking-as-a-Service offerings, which is where he should be focusing.

Moser: Yeah. And you know, Green Dot was dealing with its fair share of challenges earlier on, but it's really been a tremendous year for the stock. I know that the listeners appreciate you having been able to keep up with them, because they've made a lot of progress, and patient shareholders are really being rewarded in exercising that patience now. So, it's great to see that success with Green Dot.

What about MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI), Matt? This is a company that we've often referred to as the Amazon of Latin America. To me, that is just such a small part of the story, it feels like when you look at the actual -- the fintech operations or the payment operations that they have there, not to mention things like fulfillment, logistics, and whatnot. But I mean, another just tremendous quarter from -- well, let's just call it, the Amazon of Latin America, right. [laughs]

Frankel: [laughs] Yeah. Well, I call them, like, the Amazon and Square of Latin America all-in-one, is kind of how I would put it. Because there's really two sides to their business, there's the e-commerce platform, which is the Amazon of Latin America, and then there is the payments platform, MercadoPago, which is, you know, kind of the Square or PayPal, if you will, of Latin America. The growth on both sides of the business was extremely impressive.

This is not Amazon where it's a really mature e-commerce marketplace, this is still in the earlier stages of growth. So, I'll call this, like, Amazon, you know, circa 2005, if I had to put a year on it. On the e-commerce side of the business, the gross merchandise volume sold on the platform was up to 117%, so that more than doubled year-over-year. 205 million items were sold on the platform, which sounds like a lot, but go look up how much Amazon sold on its platform and it'll seem like a tiny number.

On the payment side of the business, that's where it gets really impressive, they did $14.5 billion U.S. equivalent in payment volume, which as we just mentioned PayPal's numbers, that's about one-twentieth [5%] of what PayPal does. But it's growing at an off the charts pace, 161% year-over-year payments volume growth. And the best part is, that the payment volume that came from off of its e-commerce platform is growing even faster, that tripled year-over-year.

It's easy enough for MercadoLibre to promote its payments platform to people already selling on its platform. So, think of this as, you know, eBay getting people to use PayPal back when they were both the same company. But it was tougher for PayPal to get people who weren't on eBay to use their platform, and that's kind of what you're seeing MercadoLibre doing a great job of right now.

I became a shareholder during the pandemic, and I'd been meaning to pull the trigger on that one for years. I wish I had listened to myself a few years ago, but better late than never. And the recent results show me that this is still in the early stages.

Moser: Yeah. And, you know, I think for me, when I look at MercadoLibre, to me, it really is all about the boom in Latin America's middle class. And I think even the room that they have still to run there. I mean, if you look at the numbers between 2008 and 2018, Latin America's middle class expanded from 33 million households to 46 million households. And making up a far greater proportion of the overall household as well. It seems like that number is poised to continue growing, which obviously speaks volumes for the opportunity in front of MercadoLibre.

Do you think, and I tend to probably think not, but do you think there is ever the chance that they would spin that payment side of the business out as its own separate publicly traded company or do you feel like they would be better off keeping that in-house?

Frankel: For the time being, they should keep it in-house. I mentioned the PayPal-eBay example, I think when it becomes kind of a more mature business like PayPal and eBay, where the growth within the platform is kind of limited at that point, things like that, then it might be worth looking at spinning it out. But for right now, it's a very valuable asset that they're doing a great job of growing alongside their core business.

Moser: Yep, yep, it makes sense. Well, before we wrap things up, Matt, let's give our listeners one to watch for the coming week. What's your one to watch this coming week?

Frankel: Well, this is my -- when we did the recent stocks we want... you mentioned Bill.com, I'm going with Lemonade, which reports its earnings on Wednesday. That was my recent stock I bought. This will be their first earnings report as a publicly traded company. The performance has been pretty good for the stock right now. I want to see if their business results are backing that up, if they're still growing like I think they're capable of, and if management is still making the right moves. So, I'll report back next week after they report their earnings, but that's what I'm keeping my eye on this week.

Moser: Nice. Well, I'll go with a company that's a little bit less financial -- it's not directly financials related, but it is a company that is very much tied to the consumer, and one that's been dealing with a lot of, not bad news, but just a difficult situation. Disney earnings come out later this week on Thursday, clearly, they've been, you know, on the [laughs] one side of coin with their focus on streaming and entertainment, I mean, the business has really done very well. The flip side of the coin there is that, you know, the parks have been closed. And that has been a real anchor, particularly with what's going on in California. I mean, they can't get anything going out there.

You know, you were telling me the story, you guys went down there recently to Disney World, Orlando and it sounded like they were taking things very seriously and had a pretty good thing going there. So, it was encouraging to see that they were able, at least, to get some traffic going there. But the stock responding to this vaccine news today, obviously, very positively. Stock, right now as we're taping up, about 12%, [laughs] that's a big move for a company like Disney. So, I'm going to be very encouraged to see what their language is like on that call regarding this vaccine news and the state of the Park's business in general, so I'll be keeping an eye on that.

But, Matt, I think that is going to wrap it up for us this week. We had a little bit of a long show today. We had a lot to talk about. Man, I appreciate you sitting in and taking care of us today.

Frankel: I'm enjoying watching all the real estate stocks go up. You know, I'm the advisor on our new Real Estate Winners service, Real.Fool.com, if anyone wants to check it out. But, I mean, it's a great day for REITs, so we're having a fantastic time watching it today. Some of our Real Estate Winners they're really living up to their names.

Apple's New M1 Chip Could Boost Mac Margins,Motley Fool,6 days ago,"Apple's silicon delivers improved performance while significantly enhancing power efficiency, leading to massive gains in battery life. Developing the M1 cost ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/12/apples-new-m1-chip-could-boost-mac-margins/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","After nearly a decade of speculation, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at long last unveiled its first ARM-based Macs -- MacBook Air, MacBook, and Mac Mini -- powered by its new M1 chip, displacing Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) processors after 15 years. Apple's silicon delivers improved performance while significantly enhancing power efficiency, leading to massive gains in battery life.

Developing the M1 cost billions, but the new chip could still bode well for Apple's Mac margins in the long run.

Ditching Intel

For starters, Intel chips cost hundreds of dollars each. Apple has undoubtedly secured volume discounts, but how much it pays the chip giant has never been clear. Analysts estimate that Intel sells about $3.4 billion in chips to Apple annually, but lacking unit sales data, it's difficult to estimate how much Apple pays for each processor.

By switching to its own processors, Apple will pay far less -- just the manufacturing costs that it pays to foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM).

Investors have long anticipated these cost savings, but they didn't know what Apple would do with them. Would Apple pass along those savings to consumers in the form of lower prices, or pocket them to expand margins?

A little bit of both

Ahead of the event, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee estimated that the shift would result in $75 per unit in cost savings. The analyst expected Apple to offer a new laptop priced in between the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which could boost demand and sell more units.

It turns out that the answer is a mix of both strategies. The M1-powered MacBook Air and MacBook Pro have the same respective starting prices, but the M1-powered Mac Mini is getting a $100 price cut. The MacBook Air is the Cupertino tech giant's most popular model, so most of those cost savings will translate into higher margins.

However, it could take some time for those higher margins to materialize. Generally speaking, processors built on the newest manufacturing technologies -- in this case, TMSC's 5-nanometer process -- often run into low yields as the foundry works out early kinks. Low yields lead to higher unit costs, as some of the silicon wafer ends up wasted. As the manufacturing process matures, yields improve, and costs come down.

Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong believes this may be why Apple kept the M1-powered MacBooks at the same price points. But over time, the costs per unit should decline and result in greater profitability. Once the rest of the Mac lineup is transitioned to Apple processors, earnings per share could increase by an estimated $0.13, or about 3%, according to Cowen analyst Krish Sankar.

""The new M1 chip is a positive step in leveraging existing R&D investments in silicon design ... [giving] better control over its technology road map while also allowing the company to optimize the cost structure of Mac systems going forward,"" Sankar wrote in a research note to investors this week.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.722, 'pos': 0.278, 'compound': 0.4019}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.636, 'pos': 0.364, 'compound': 0.7906}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.636, 'pos': 0.364, 'compound': 0.7906}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.3953,0.4019,0.3953,0.39749999999999996,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive
Why You Should Be Buying This Tech Stock in November,Motley Fool,6 days ago,"The chipmaker reportedly gets a substantial chunk of its revenue from Apple, and its largest customer supplied 21% of the total revenue last quarter. Synaptics' ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/12/why-you-should-be-buying-this-tech-stock-november/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Synaptics (NASDAQ:SYNA) has beaten the broader stock market handsomely over the past year thanks to its shift to a higher-margin business model, and it looks like the shares have more upside to offer given the company's latest quarterly results.

The chipmaker's fiscal 2021 first-quarter earnings jumped significantly over the prior-year period on the back of strong momentum across the PC, mobile, and the Internet of Things (IoT) businesses. Synaptics exceeded its own expectations last quarter, and claims to have a nice pipeline of design wins and new product ramps that could help it move into a higher gear in this new fiscal year.

Let's see why Synaptics could remain a top tech stock and sustain its impressive rally.

Synaptics is making the right moves

Synaptics' fiscal first-quarter revenue came in at $328.4 million, down 3% over the prior-year period but higher than the midpoint of the company's guidance range of $315 million to $335 million. The lower revenue was because Synaptics' now-divested TDDI (touch and display driver integration) business was a part of the mobile segment in the year-ago quarter.

The liquid-crystal display (LCD) TDDI business generated $131 million in revenue in the first half of fiscal 2020 (about $65 million per quarter). So investors shouldn't be worried about the company's revenue decline, as it managed to substantially improve its margin profile thanks to the divestment.

Synaptics reported non-GAAP gross margin of 49.7% in the previous quarter, a huge jump over the prior-year period's figure of 41.5% and the highest level it has seen in over seven years. The company also clocked its highest operating margin in over six years. The margin gains translated into a nice earnings bump, with Synaptics reporting adjusted earnings of $1.85 per share, compared to $1.22 per share in the year-ago quarter.

The company is expected to enjoy strong earnings growth through the new fiscal year thanks to the divestment of the TDDI business and its focus on the higher-margin organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display driver segment. Rosenblatt Securities estimates that the sale of the TDDI business could boost Synaptics' earnings by $0.45 to $0.55 per share in fiscal 2021.

Major catalysts ahead

Synaptics' mobile business supplied 40% of its total revenue last quarter, and it is playing a key role in driving up its margins as the smartphone market shifts from LCDs to OLEDs. The company anticipates 10 new smartphones equipped with its OLED touch controllers to hit the market in the coming months, though it may have a huge winner on its hands in the form of the new Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 12 models.

Synaptics management pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that:

We also had our major handset OEM [original equipment manufacturer] announce their new flagship phones last month powered by our OLED touch controller.

The chipmaker reportedly gets a substantial chunk of its revenue from Apple, and its largest customer supplied 21% of the total revenue last quarter. Synaptics' mobile revenue shot up 25% year over year after adjusting for the sale of the TDDI business, and it is likely to sustain its momentum given reports that Apple is preparing to increase production and ship over 200 million units next year. The new iPhones could drive a mega upgrade cycle for Apple, and Synaptics could ride on the smartphone giant's coattails.

Looking beyond mobile, Synaptics is turning up the heat in the IoT business. The segment accounted for 35% of Synaptics' revenue last quarter, and it is expected to exceed the mobile business in size in the fiscal second quarter. The IoT business is benefiting from a broad range of growth trends in video interface solutions, audio chips, and smart homes.

With the IoT chip market expected to clock double-digit growth rates in the coming years, according to third-party estimates, it isn't surprising to see why Synaptics sees better days ahead in this business. So, investors who have been on the sidelines so far should take a closer look at Synaptics, as it has the ingredients to keep growing at a nice clip.

Finally, Synaptics trades at an attractive valuation. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24 is way lower than the five-year average multiple of 94. Meanwhile, a forward P/E ratio of 14.6 points toward future earnings growth, which Synaptics should be able to deliver given the catalysts it is sitting on.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.927, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.2023}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.927, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.2023}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.10115,0.0,0.10115,0.06743333333333333,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Positive,Neutral,Somewhat Positive

It has been a front-runner in the technology sector ever since its early days and its products have helped propel its stock price, making it one of the largest companies in the world by market cap.

Despite its already massive size, Apple continues to report growth. Still, Apple's size is weighing down on its growth rate and if the recent growth trend continues, it's unlikely that Apple's share price performance for the next decade can match the past.

Fortunately, there are many other leading tech stocks with better prospects than Apple that investors can consider. One of them is Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY).

The rise of a major tech company

Tencent is the No. 1 player in China across multiple business segments: online games, mobile messaging, online video, online payment, and music, just to mention a few. Its flagship social media app, WeChat, has 1.2 billion monthly active users (MAUs), behind only Facebook, which has 2.7 billion MAUs.

It didn't begin as a sure-win business. It started as a one-product company focusing on QQ -- an instant messaging software -- in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The product became a hit among users, making it the de facto instant messaging software in China during the PC era. Tencent then went on to provide additional services -- online games, entertainment, news, and more -- to delight its hundreds of millions of users. Its crown jewel, WeChat, came much later, and in many ways is an evolved version of QQ tailored for the mobile era.

Why is Tencent so successful

Among all the things that have contributed to Tencent's success, two stand out: its massive user base and its diversified business model.

The former is a result of Tencent's leadership in social messaging tools, which are extremely popular among Chinese users thanks to the strong network effect -- where every additional user will make its network more valuable to all existing users.

Unlike its peers such as WhatsApp, which remains mainly a messaging app, WeChat went further by offering all kinds of other services, including e-commerce, online food ordering, payments, blogging, games, and music. These additional services not only make WeChat extremely sticky among its users, but they also became new income streams for Tencent.

The result? A diversified and profitable technology conglomerate. Between 2004, the year of its IPO, and 2019, Tencent grew revenue and net profit by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47%, and 43%, respectively. It might seem that its business model runs the risk of making it a jack-of-all-trades and a master of none, but instead of doing everything on its own, Tencent has extensive partnerships (including holding stakes) with other companies in areas including e-commerce and online food delivery. These relationships help solidify its ecosystem.

A strength you may be overlooking



Many investors don't know that Tencent is probably one of the best (if not the best) capital allocators in the world. According to South China Morning Post, Tencent had invested in about 700 companies for the decade ended in 2019, many of which have either gone public or become unicorns, private companies with a valuation of more than $1 billion.

Some of its better-known investments are Pinduoduo, Meituan, JD, Sea Ltd, EPIC games, and Didi. Tencent owns more than 10% of each of those companies. It also owns minority stakes in leading companies like Tesla, Snap, Spotify, and Uber. As of June 30, these investments had a value of about $77 billion.

These companies are leaders in their respective fields, and Tencent stands to benefit as they continue to grow. With its streams of cash coming in each year, Tencent will likely continue its investments in other companies to create value for its shareholders.

Nonetheless, there's a risk that future investments might not be as successful. Hence, investors should look out for potential misallocation of capital, especially if it ventures into industries far beyond its core competence.

Tencent as a long-term investment

Tencent is a rare combination of a great business operator and a successful capital allocator.

I think Tencent's future is equally bright, if not brighter, than its past. It has huge potential to grow its existing businesses in advertising, fintech, and healthcare, and also expand its younger, enterprise-facing businesses such as cloud computing.

At around a $745 billion market cap, Tencent is already a gigantic company. But a decade from now, it could be worth much more. It has a good chance to outperform Apple thanks to its smaller size and its proven capital allocation strategies.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.655, 'neu': 0.345, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.2263}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.805, 'pos': 0.195, 'compound': 0.4404}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.778, 'pos': 0.222, 'compound': 0.7506}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.778, 'pos': 0.222, 'compound': 0.7506}]",0.7506,0.10705,0.7506,0.5360833333333334,Positive,Very Positive,Somewhat Positive,Very Positive
2 Cheap Dividend Stocks You Can Buy Right Now,Motley Fool,6 days ago,"Broadcom also generated a fifth of its revenues from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) last year, so it should benefit from robust sales of the iPhone 12 over the next few ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/12/2-cheap-dividend-stocks-you-can-buy-right-now/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","With the Nasdaq hovering near all-time highs, many tech stocks can't be considered cheap. Most high-growth tech companies also don't pay dividends, since they usually reinvest their cash into their expanding businesses.

But for investors who favor stability and income over high-risk growth, there are still plenty of tech stocks that pay high dividends and trade at low valuations. Let's take a closer look at two companies that fit that description: Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and IBM (NYSE:IBM).

1. Broadcom

Broadcom sells a wide range of chips for the data center, networking hardware, storage, broadband, wireless, and industrial markets. It also expanded into the infrastructure software market with its acquisitions of CA Technologies in 2018 and Symantec's security business in 2019.

Broadcom's stock rallied about 20% this year as the strength of its infrastructure software unit offset the pandemic-related disruptions of its semiconductor business. Its total revenue rose 4% year over year in the first nine months of 2020, but its adjusted EPS dipped 1% -- mainly due to the costs of integrating Symantec's security business.

Broadcom's sales of networking and broadband chips also stabilized sequentially in the second and third quarters, as cloud and telecom customers upgraded their infrastructure to address the surge in online activity throughout the pandemic. Analysts currently expect Broadcom's revenue and earnings to rise 6% and 3%, respectively, for the full year.

But looking into 2021, analysts expect Broadcom's revenue and earnings to rise 9% and 16%, respectively, as the pandemic passes and the expanding 5G and cloud markets lift sales of its networking and wireless chips. Broadcom also generated a fifth of its revenues from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) last year, so it should benefit from robust sales of the iPhone 12 over the next few quarters.

Broadcom has a well-diversified business, a wide moat, and its stock trades at just 15 times forward earnings. It currently pays a forward dividend yield of 3.4%, and it plans to spend about half of its free cash flow (FCF) on dividends every year. It spent 48% of its FCF on its dividend over the past 12 months -- which indicates its dividend remains rock-solid even as other companies cut or suspend their payouts.

2. IBM

IBM became a Dividend Aristocrat of the S&P 500 earlier this year after raising its dividend for the 25th straight year. Unfortunately, joining that elite group didn't prevent IBM's stock from dropping 14% this year as investors lost patience with its sluggish turnaround efforts.

But three significant things recently happened at IBM. First, IBM acquired the open source software provider Red Hat in July 2019. That acquisition expanded its hybrid cloud business, which allows companies to store their data on both public cloud platforms and on-site private clouds.

Second, Arvind Krishna, IBM's cloud and cognitive solutions chief, succeeded Ginni Rometty as its new CEO in April and immediately focused on expanding its higher-growth cloud businesses.

Lastly, Krishna recently revealed IBM would spin off its slow-growth IT services segment into a new company that prioritizes the growth of its hybrid cloud and AI businesses. That spin-off won't happen until late 2021, but it indicates IBM is finally streamlining its sprawling business and focusing on growing its revenue again.

For now, IBM's growth looks anemic. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to decline 4% and 34%, respectively, this year, as the ongoing pandemic throttles the growth of most of its non-cloud businesses.

But looking ahead into 2021, analysts expect IBM's revenue and earnings to rise 1% and 38%, respectively, as the pandemic passes. After IBM spins off its IT services segment, which constantly erases the growth of its cloud-based businesses, its growth should accelerate significantly in 2022 and beyond.

IBM's stock won't blast off anytime soon, but it trades at just 10 times forward earnings and pays a meaty forward dividend yield of 5.7%. It's unclear if the ""new"" IBM will remain a Dividend Aristocrat after its upcoming split, but the company has said that both new companies will pay a combined quarterly dividend that is ""no less"" than IBM's current dividend.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.173, 'compound': 0.6872}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.173, 'compound': 0.6872}]",0.6872,0.0,0.6872,0.45813333333333334,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive

Prepared Remarks:

Operator

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the third-quarter 2020 Jamf earnings conference call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Jennifer Gaumond.

Ma'am, you may begin.

Jennifer Gaumond -- Investor Relations

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Jamf's third-quarter 2020 financial results. With me on today's call are Dean Hager, Jamf's chief executive officer; and Jill Putman, the company's chief financial officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that shortly after the market closed today, Jamf issued a press release announcing its third-quarter 2020 financial results. Additionally, we published an updated investor presentation.

You may access the press release and presentation on the Investor Relations section of jamf.com. Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements, please refer to our most recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q and our IPO prospectus dated July 21, 2020, where you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these statements. I would also like to remind you that during the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures related to Jamf's performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in our quarterly financial statements.

To ensure we can address as many analyst questions as possible during the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one initial question and one follow-up. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dean Hager. Dean?

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Jennifer, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on our third-quarter earnings call. For our call today, I will share highlights from the quarter and then provide an update about the exciting momentum in our business. I'll finish with a recap of our annual user conference before turning it over to Jill to review our third-quarter financials. While a challenging macroeconomic environment persists, the tailwinds of telehealth, distance learning, and remote work in the third quarter offset economic headwinds and drove strong Jamf sales growth and customer acquisition.

Total revenue in the third quarter grew 29% year over year to $70.4 million, driven by recurring revenue growth of 40% year over year to $65.8 million, now 93% of total revenues. Annual recurring revenue or ARR was $261.5 million growing 37% year over year. Non-GAAP operating income was $12 million in the quarter or 17% of revenue. This was a 0.5 point decrease over the third quarter of 2019.

And unlevered free cash flow totaled $28.2 million in the third quarter, representing an unlevered free cash flow margin of 40%. This compares with a margin of 33% for third-quarter 2019. Our strong third-quarter results reflect the continuing trend of IT consumerization the fuels the growth of Apple and the enterprise. This trend where employees demand to use at work, the technology they already love at home, has accelerated over the past six months.

Jamf has responded by helping thousands of organizations around the globe implement remote work solutions, as well as helping schools with distance-learning and hospitals with their telehealth solutions. Jamf's value to customers and our business results continue to strengthen as these trends further route themselves into daily life, both in the short term and far into the future. Despite the challenges of 2020, Jamf remains dedicated to our customer success, and we have continued to invest in new features and enhancements that fulfill our mission to help them succeed with Apple. As organizations work hard to provide a safe environment for their teams and customers, technology plays an important role across industries like retail, transportation, and healthcare.

Jamf continues to support this effort and gains momentum with our innovative products such as Jamf Setup and Jamf Reset that enables shared yet personalized usage of iPhones and iPads. And for workflows specifically designed for hospitals, Jamf's Healthcare Listener integrates with our hospitals' electronic medical record system and listens to the messages like a patient discharge or transfer and automatically performs the desired remote command like wiping the device or associating the device with all of the connected things in the patient's new hospital room. This workflow uses iPads to create a better and more engaging experience for the patient without requiring time or effort from the IT or hospital staff. Jamf's Virtual Visits solutions, which launched weeks after the COVID-19 outbreak allow patients to seamlessly and securely connect with doctors and their families through third-party video meeting platforms like ZOOM and Microsoft Team.

UCHealth in Colorado is just one hospital using all of these innovations. In 2018, UCHealth began using Jamf to streamline their technology management and practices by offering an iPad at each patient's bedside. They utilized Healthcare Listener, Jamf Setup, and Jamf Reset to digitally sterilize the device between each patient and easily set it up for the next patient without the need for IT assistance. As virtual care need spiked, this quarter UCHealth started using our Virtual Visits workflow and ramped up from less than 50 virtual visits a day to over 1,500.

Both Healthcare Listener and Virtual Visits have patents pending. Also during this quarter, Jamf advanced our relationship with hospitals around the world by implementing clinical communication workflows. Cincinnati Children's Hospital, the number three children's hospital in the U.S. selected Jamf for thousands of iPhones for nurses to help optimize clinical communication and patient care.

And they also used our solution to deploy iPads to patient rooms for entertainment, social connection, and access to medical information directly from their Epic electronic medical record system. Additionally, Cincinnati Children's extended their Jamf usage to Apple TVs and patient rooms. Jamf's unique healthcare capabilities across the entire Apple ecosystem of products led to these hospitals choosing Jamf over legacy MDM solutions in order to succeed with their Telehealth, clinical communication, and patient bedside initiatives. In the third quarter, Jamf also experienced strong growth in the education market, largely driven by a worldwide requirement for schools to be distance-learning ready.

These programs are aided through government funding like the CARES Act in the U.S., the GIGA project in Japan, and DiGA pack in Germany. In Japan, Jamf on-boarded 56 school districts, which include over 1,000 schools in Q3 alone. In the US, Jamf is the clear leader for Apple Enterprise Management in education. We serve 12 of the 15 largest school districts in the United States.

Eight of these schools have increased their seat count with Jamf since the COVID-19 outbreak. Jamf has been preparing schools for kids to learn from their homes for years whether they know it or not. Our Jamf Teacher app provides educators with real-time classroom remote control of each student's Apple technology from any distance, and our Jamf Parent app allows parents to do the same. Both these apps are designed to empower adults to help students avoid potential distractions and focus on their studies.

Since the pandemic began, Jamf has further advanced our solution, including new capabilities such as teachers virtually ringing the bell in order to easily starts their video class room, and allowing students to virtually raise their hand in order to gain further assistance from educators, which is valuable for students learning at home or in a classroom setting. Last month, we also launched Jamf Assessment, an app that empowers schools to issue remotely proctored exams, where it's necessary to visually supervise students like with college placement exams or another high-stake testing, something that was not previously possible on the iPad. Sewanhaka Central High School District in New York used Jamf Assessment this quarter to allow students to take the Accuplacer test, a test that assists colleges in placing students in the right courses, helping them continue to build their future, despite the uncertainty stemming from the pandemic. Additionally, Jamf is seeing strong interest for both Mac and iPad in higher education.

The Ohio State University has been providing iPads for every incoming freshman since 2018 as part of their digital flagship program. In the third quarter of 2020, Ohio State conducted a survey that own well over 90% of their students agreed that iPads are useful for academic purposes and a valuable tool for their education. Similarly, the University of Kentucky is in the second year of issuing iPad technology to first-year students. More than 11,000 devices have been distributed as part of a wider smart campus strategy geared toward better leveraging technology in new and innovative ways.

In total, over 300 universities or higher education customers have expanded their use of Jamf, since the COVID-19 pandemic began. We believe the strong Apple usage in universities further confirmed Jamf's research finding that over 70% of college students would prefer to use a Mac at work if given the choice after graduation. Speaking of using Apple at work, the need to remotely and securely connect and empower employees working from their homes has continued to lead companies to choose Jamf, and grow their Apple and, specifically Mac usage. This trend, which was gaining popularity before the pandemic, has been accelerated this year and we believe will continue into the future.

In the third quarter, Jamf advanced workflows that improve the employee experience, security, and IT efficiency through Jamf Connect and Jamf Protect. Jamf released new capabilities in Jamf Protect and announced a new version of Jamf Connect that makes it easier to deploy and further streamline employee on boarding and authentication using single sign-on and biometrics with password-must access to the Mac using Face ID from an iPhone. These advancements led to approximately 700 customers choosing Jamf Connect, and approximately 200 customers choosing Jamf Protect, which was launched exactly one year ago today since the COVID-19 outbreak began. In the third quarter, Upwork, Everlane, and HSBC are all examples of new Jamf Connect wins.

And examples of Jamf Protect wins include Gilead Sciences, Data health and SAP, but SAP having already deployed Jamf Protect to over 28,000 MacBooks. These customers are part of a fast-growing trend, where organizations leverage Jamf's entire Apple Enterprise Management platform. As part of our expansion initiatives, Jamf is now offering a new user base pricing bundle called Jamf Business Plan, which includes Jamf Pro, Jamf Protect, and Jamf Connect across all Apple devices used by employees. Jamf Business Plan provides organizations with a complete solution that delivers a strong return on investment and lower support costs.

All of these new capabilities were showcased as we closed Q3 when we hosted approximately 20,000 attendees at our virtual Jamf Nation User Conference, also known as JNUC, which is 10 times our normal in-person conference attendance. JNUC is annually the largest gathering of Apple IT admins globally and we believe this year's JNUC was the largest gathering of Apple IT admins anywhere ever. This year we welcomed many first timers, who have not participated in previous conferences, plus an amazing 28% of attendees this year were Jamf prospects, not customers, which supports the strong and growing demand we have seen for Apple Enterprise Management. JNUC provides a forum for collaboration in this year was no different, based on the communication threads during the event and Chatter that we experienced post-event.

On average virtual JNUC attendees spent more than 30 hours in the platform, engaging and participating in Jamf content, and nine and 10 agreed that JNUC 2020 met their expectations and plan to attend again a virtual next year. The theme of the conference was a year like no other, and we showcased many of the platform enhancements, I mentioned earlier, that are powering the learn, care and work anywhere trends, along with customer and partner stories and how they were able to succeed during this time using Apple and Jamf. Apple and Microsoft representatives also joined us on stage, again this year, to talk about our important partnerships and what they bring to the Apple IT and security communities. We announced we are expanding our collaboration with Microsoft Enterprise Mobility and Security by launching iOS Device Compliance.

Through this offering, which adds to our already robust partnership, organizations are empowered to choose Jamf or Apple Enterprise, including device compliance and security monitoring for remote staff, and Microsoft Endpoint Manager for any other devices. As trends like employee technology choice programs and IT continue to grow organizations need management tools that can adapt and shift to a hybrid environment, while still giving the native and intended end-user experience. At JNUC, we also announced our acquisition of Mondada. Mondada's Kinobi solutions are considered the leading solution and patch management for the Apple platform.

Built exclusively around Jamf, Kinobi, and Kinobi Pro managed software compliance on macOS, a major initiative, and a pain point for today's IT teams. We believe with Jamf's resources, we can extend these capabilities and bring even greater value to organizations using the Apple ecosystem through a complete application lifecycle management solution. We closed this tuck-in acquisition on October 15. As we look into the future, we are excited about the continued transformation of the enterprise, as the consumerization of IT results in more Apple devices, empowering employees at work, educating students in school, and helping provide care for patients and hospitals and at home.

While the events of 2020 have accelerated these trends, we believe we are still in the early innings of this transformation. Going forward, Jamf commits to continue innovating at the pace of Apple, supporting new operating systems and hardware on the same day it's released, including the recently announced Mac lineup based on the Apple M1 chip, and Apple's latest operating system Big Sur, which became generally available today. We believe Mac will become increasingly the device of choice for many in the workplace, especially the newest generation of workers, and that Jamf is best positioned to help organizations easily adapt and get the most out of this new technology over time. Unlike cross-platform management and security solutions that are still struggling to fully support macOS Catalina let alone macOS Big Sur.

Jamf is solely focused on Apple and for a decade has supported an extended Apple's latest innovations from the day they are available. In closing, we are excited to be a part of this movement and to support the continued growth in the large and growing Apple Enterprise Management market. Now I would like to turn the call over to Jill to walk through our financial results and guidance. Jill?

Jill Putman -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Dean, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. I'll start by discussing our third-quarter results in detail before moving on to guidance. As Dean mentioned, we had a very strong third quarter. Total revenue for the third quarter was $70.4 million, growing 29% year over year, reflecting strong growth across all of our subscription products.

Recurring revenue totaled $65.8 million in the third quarter, an increase of 40% year over year, and accounted for 93% of our total revenue versus 86% in the third quarter last year, while non-recurring revenue was $4.6 million. Due to product mix shift, we saw a favorable impact from products that deliver in-quarter recurring revenue as the education vertical and our Jamf's Connect product outperformed our expectations. ARR, as of September 30th, was $261.5 million, an increase of 37% year over year. As a reminder, ARR represents the annualized value of all subscription, support, and maintenance contracts as of the end of the period.

ARR mitigates fluctuations due to seasonality, contract term, and the sales mix of subscription for term-based licenses versus staff. Three primary drivers underpin the growth of our ARR. First, our consistent high device expansion rates, second, our strong new logo acquisition, and third, the upselling and cross-selling of products into our installed base. We expect to continue benefiting from these trends going forward.

We believe our ability to grow the number of devices on our software platform is a key indicator of our growth and trajectory. As of the end of Q3, we had 18.6 million devices on our platform, representing strong growth in both the education and commercial verticals and across all major geographies as demand continues for organizations to remotely connect, manage, and protect their Apple devices. We have a history of attracting new customers and growing their annual spend with us over time, which drives our high-dollar-based net retention rate. We accomplished this by adding devices to our platform and expanding our customers' adoption of our add-on products.

Our dollar-based net retention rate remained strong at 117% for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2020. Before turning to expense items and profitability, I would like to highlight that I will refer to non-GAAP results for my remaining remarks. Our GAAP financial results along with reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP are found in our earnings release. Gross profit was $58.2 million, up 35% year over year, while gross margin expanded four points to 83%.

We expect our gross margin to increase over time as compared to the rates we delivered prior to the impact of COVID, as recurring revenue becomes the larger proportion of revenue and as an increase the average ARR per device. Turning to operating expenses, we remain focused on improving the leverage in our business, while balancing our investments for growth. With the strength of our operating results year to date, we've been able to increase our investment throughout the organization by turning our original 2020 hiring plan back on. As a result, to date, Jamf has on-boarded 250 new employees since the beginning of the year, which has been aided by leveraging Jamf's zero-touch technology in the midst of the pandemic.

Total operating expense for Q3 was $46.3 million, compared to $33.6 million in Q3 last year. Year-over-year growth was driven primarily by continued investments in our global go-to-market strategy as well as investments in research and development as innovation in both our existing and new products and features remains a top priority for us. In addition, beginning in the third quarter, we now have incremental expense related to being a public company. As a reminder, we delayed some planned spending in Q2 due to COVID and invested a portion of that expense savings this quarter.

The larger portion of that savings will be invested between now and the end of the year, resulting in an uptick in spending in the fourth quarter. Our operating income in the quarter was $12 million, compared to $9.6 million in Q3 last year. Operating margin was 17%, representing a half-point decrease compared to the same period last year, reflecting investments required to be a public company, partially offset by improved gross margin. Our basic average share count was 113.2 million and our diluted average share count was 116.7 million for the quarter as compared to 102.8 million and 104.6 million, respectively in the third quarter of 2019.

Unlevered free cash flow was $28.2 million in Q3 compared to $17.9 million for Q3 2019. Third-quarter unlevered free cash flow represents 40% of total revenue, up from 33% of total revenue a year ago. Our operating model of high growth and improving efficiency yield strong cash flow generation, which in the third quarter also benefited from seasonally strong billings in the education vertical, which outpaced the increase in our operating cost investments. Late in the quarter, we accelerated our hiring efforts and expect to make further investments in the fourth quarter.

Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $177.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. And, finally, we turn to guidance for the fourth quarter. Our business has seen some benefits from several trends emerging during this challenging time, including the proliferation of telehealth, remote learning, and the rise of a more permanent work-from-home movement. At the same time, there is embedded uncertainty around the IT spending environment as renewals, capital spending, and new IT projects are subject to more scrutiny across organizations everywhere.

In light of these dynamics and our strong performance in the third quarter, we are increasing our full-year 2020 revenue and non-GAAP operating income expectations. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect total revenue in the range of $70 million to $71 million, representing growth of 23% to 25% year over year and a 3.7% increase from previous implied guidance. Non-GAAP operating income in the range of $1 million to $2 million. For the full-year 2020, we expect total revenue in the range of $263 million to $264 million, representing growth of 28% to 29% year over year and a 2.9% increase from previous guidance.

Non-GAAP operating income in the range of $28.5 million to $29.5 million, reflecting the increase in operating expenses related to accelerated hiring and reinvesting our over-performance back into the business as discussed earlier. For modeling purposes, we are providing the following information. We expect an annual effective tax rate of 25%. As a reminder, we use our statutory tax rate when calculating tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments, which is not materially different from our annual effective tax.

For calculating GAAP EPS, we expect basic weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately $116 million for the fourth quarter and $109 million for the full-year 2020. In closing, we are very pleased with our performance in the third quarter and look forward to sharing our results in the quarters ahead. With that, Dan and I will take your questions. Operator?

Questions & Answers:

Operator

[Operator instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Your line is open.

Sterling Auty -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst

Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. I didn't know I could actually make comment.

I would have prepared some remarks for you. Maybe just to get started, let's talk about the education vertical in particular. Can you give us a sense of what was the mix of products that you saw most in demand? You had given some anecdotal highlights, but what are you seeing in terms of the uptake in the product portfolio, specifically to education? And can you give us a sense of what was the education mix as a percentage of either bookings or revenue, whichever you feel comfortable giving?

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

What I'll do is I'll just comment a little bit about products. Thanks, Sterling, by the way for the question and for joining us. And then I'll kick it over to Jill for the mix. So on products, you'll recall that our cross-sell products of Jamf Protect and Jamf Connect are the primary cross-sell products we have.

Those to date have been mostly selling within commercial markets. So, therefore, the bookings that are occurring within education are either for the Jamf Pro product or the Jamf School product. And both in Q3 just performed extremely well as educators around the world have diverse needs, and one of those solutions seems to fit each customer's needs uniquely. So both performed very, very well worldwide.

Jill Putman -- Chief Financial Officer

As far as the split of where the business comes from between commercial and education, Sterling, not to dissimilar to our run rates, however, education was a little bit heavier than a typical Q3 because of the kind of the tail end of some of the COVID-related distance learning spend. But because revenues driven by the ARR, the revenue split continues to be in the range of 60% commercial, 40% education.

Sterling Auty -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst

All right. Great. And then in terms of follow-up, how should we think about 5G in the way that Apple is starting to incorporate them into their devices? And as we think about, M1 chip and maybe a 5G-enabled iPad, how do you expect that to impact enterprise adoption and ultimately Jamf's uptake?

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Very interesting question Sterling. I, for one, think that 5G is transformative, and again different areas of the world were at different spots on and their maturity in that area. And there are some areas of the world that frankly are more keen on 5G connectivity, then Wi-Fi connectivity in some spots.

And I think it has the potential, especially within education to be very transformative. During the pandemic, one of the big concerns has been our students are able to get connected from their homes. We have seen an uptick of LTE-enabled iPads in those situations so that educators could make sure that our students had connectivity from their home. And again, these will be school-issued iPads.

I think with the emergence of 5G on its way, it could potentially be very transformative to both education and in commercial markets to just have connectivity all the time. That's very, very fast.

Sterling Auty -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst

Makes sense. Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.

Unknown speaker

Hi. This is RJ on behalf of Rod. Thanks for taking my question. And congrats on the solid results.

Could you give us an update on your pipeline and the demand trajectory you're seeing? And based on your conversations with customers, how long do you expect this favorable environment to persist? And I have a follow-up.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Thank you for the question. So the question being about the pipeline, we are seeing a type of pipeline coverage that is very similar to what we would have expected to see had a pandemic not occurred. We're very confident in our pipeline coverage.

And again, from a total coverage perspective, it's about the same as what we would have expected and what we've experienced in the past. As a matter of fact, at this moment, it's a little bit stronger than it's been over say the course of the last six months or so. The difference is a little bit of the mix. We see, obviously, tremendous strength in education, so it's a little bit stronger than normal.

But overall, it's about what we would expect. And as we go forward, we don't have visibility to a time where that's really changing. Again, what we've noticed more than anything as the pandemic has progressed or the time period has progressed is the mix from geography or an industry might shift, but the overall value remains roughly about what we would have expected.

Unknown speaker

And as a follow-up, when can we expect Jamf's Connect and Jamf Protect for IOS? And could you also give us an update on your plans to target any other adjacent markets? Thank you.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

So on Jamf Connect and Jamf Protect, you are correct, that they are designed today for macOS. And I would just say that it is within our strategic intent to be able to add our access management and identity capabilities and endpoint security capabilities eventually on the other Apple devices like iOS an iPadOS. I have nothing to announce in terms from a timing perspective, but strategically you're right in line of what we would intend to do going forward. From a market perspective, there are a couple of ways of answering that.

One would be from a geographic standpoint. One of the markets that is emerging for us this year has been Latin America and we're very excited about its potential in the future, although it's very young for us. Other markets that we launched into a few years ago like Japan are performing extraordinarily well. Japan was very much a highlight for us in Q3.

When it comes to industries, it's going to be those industries, especially that remote work is supported that we're going to do extraordinarily well in, and then also industries where iOS devices have a transformative ability to sit between customer and the provider in order, one, to keep people safe, but also just to have a more efficient workflow. Those are going to be the markets that we're going to do best in.

Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line from Bhavan Suri from William Blair. Your line is open.

Bhavan Suri -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

Thank you. Hey, Dean. Hey, Jill. Congrats.

Nice job there. I guess I want to touch a little bit on two things. One is we've always seen some great news about the progress of the vaccine, but we've also seen cases spike and potential lockdowns in Europe, certainly, and then potentially in the US. You've had some deals pushed, deal cycles extended, and obviously offset by some traction.

I'm not talking about the quarter, but as you look forward, how are you thinking about the business given that environment? Do you think that we end up going back to what happened in March, April, May? Or do you think that actually we've sort of gone around that we understand how this works? And we might be able to kind of see those pipelines, you just mentioned, Dean, so we actually play out a little faster with less delays. How should we think about what you're thinking about and modeling for the future so strategically?

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. So thanks, Bhavan, for your question. Well, I wish I could predict the future. I wish I had that talent that pertains to the pandemic.

I'm not there.

Bhavan Suri -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

You don't have a crystal ball?

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. But I will remind you that one of the interesting things with Jamf is, I mean, we're really tracking on the year about where we would have predicted to be last January 1. We just ended up getting there a different way. In this particular case, diversity is our friend, diversity in industry and diversity in geography, so that even if there are certain areas of the business that are down, others for completely different reasons are up.

As we've mentioned before, we see the same economic headwinds as do everyone else, but we've got these great tailwinds like telehealth and distance learning, and work from home that have really benefited our business. And going forward, frankly, I can look at areas of the business that will strengthen when the pandemic passes, and I will look at areas of the business that will strengthen or should the pandemic persist for a bit. I think more than anything what we've noticed is that the pandemic has awakened industries to what is possible with technology. And we think more than anything, it is actually accelerated the adoption of work from home and industry transformation in such a way that once the headwinds persist, we believe the tailwinds will continue forward.

Bhavan Suri -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

Yes. No. That's helpful. I mean, I think you're probably right there even despite not having the pure crystal ball.

I'd like to touch a little bit around partners. You have a great set of partners, you've got resellers, you've got a whole bunch of interesting relationships where you've engaged, despite the current set of environments. I guess I'd love to saying how you think about investing more there and what back to potentially be as a percentage of revenue long term against not any necessarily guidance, but sort of how you think that plays out of the next three years to five years, given they're so valuable and so well set up to sort of play this game as long as they understand, especially, including, for example, the deeper relationship with Microsoft. So I'd love to understand how you think about that the investments we're making, what that might be as a percentage of revenue? Thanks.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Sure. Thanks again. And there is a couple of different ways to look at partners. Obviously, just channel partners is one of them when it comes to just splits on that, maybe I'll kick that over to Jill to make a few comments.

But overall on partnerships, of course, it's going to be part of our solution consideration. Every single piece of new value that we want to bring to our customers, we are going to make a wise-make partner or buy decision. And in many cases, we're going to be looking for an influential partner that has an excellent solution that could accompany ours as a matter of fact. If you go to marketplace.jamf.com you'll find that we have hundreds of integrations with our development partners out there to bring greater value to our customers.

In addition to those partnerships, of course, we have the very strategic partners, and the two most notable there, of course, are going to be Apple and Microsoft. On the Microsoft front, if you were able to tune into our JNUC Conference at the end of September, we announced some excellent new capabilities along with Microsoft, for instance, iOS Device Compliance that allows customers to choose Jamf for Apple Enterprise Management and Microsoft for everything else and yet still experience all the compliance checking that Microsoft has across their Enterprise and the single pane of glass reporting in inventory that so many organizations want. So we believe that almost all of the devices in an enterprise are either Windows or Apple-based. And so by Microsoft and Jamf working together, we just make things easier for the customer.

Then on channels, Jill, if you want to make a few comments?

Jill Putman -- Chief Financial Officer

So when we think about our indirect versus our direct business outside of the US, already greater than 80% of our business comes to us through the channel. On the Americas side, however, it's around 40%. And you blend that all out, it's about a 50/50 split on a global basis. But if we think about the Americas, we definitely have some opportunity there.

And that is part of our strategy going forward to look for more opportunities for more channel routes to the market.

Bhavan Suri -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

Gotcha. Gotcha. Super helpful. Thanks, guys, and really nice job.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Brad Sills from Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.

Brad Sills -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Oh, great. Hey. Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking my question.

Wanted to ask one on the dollar-based net retention. We're very healthy there in the 117 range. Has the mix of expansion changed at all since you've seen the success here with Connect and Protect more toward kind of product data on in those two categories versus, say device expansion? Any comment you can make on just the balance of what's driving that between devices and add-ons?

Jill Putman -- Chief Financial Officer

As a reminder, our dollar-based net retention expands based on devices and add-on products. So specifically to address your question on the add-on products with Connect and Protect, while Protect is still too new and too immaterial to have an impact, Connect, if you think seize back at our retention rates a year and a half, two years ago, we were in the 115%, and when bringing Connect on, we saw that nice little pop up to about 117% run rate that we've been hovering at. So being able to maintain that, so it's kind of, already, that growth and lifted baked in. And at this point, and then from here on, we'll continue to see some uplift coming from Protect as well.

Brad Sills -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

And wanted to ask about kind of early interest on some of the new vertical solutions you launched at the conference, virtual visits, and assessments, how are those tracking? What's the level of interest there? And what might that due to ASP for customers? Thank you.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Sure, Brad. And just for those are workflows that we've launched in our existing solutions so there -- those are not added back sales, but rather workflows that we've released that we would get the traditional pricing for, for instance, our Jamf Pro product. So we shouldn't be thinking about those products is being add-on sales, but rather part of the expanded device deployment to Jill's point, most of our net retention is because of a device deployment.

So the more that we released workflows that encouraged greater device adoption, we end up growing with the customer because of that. And of those, we launched a virtual visit. I believe it was right around the end of March. It was just very soon after the pandemic broke out.

We had our healthcare customers coming to us and saying, they needed a simple process that would connect patients to either caregivers or their families without the patient having to know how to do anything or set up each individual call. So we are able to get that out there relatively quick because of our electronic medical record systems integration without IT staff ever having to help. So dozens of hospitals within a matter of a month or so started looking at that solution beginning their implementations. On the Assessments app, that is a free app that's available from the App Store.

And that adoption has not taken off quite as much as what you saw with Virtual Visits, but it is really served a few customers extraordinarily well to be able to observe students take a test, especially for some of those college types of preparation tests.

Brad Sills -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Great. Thanks so much, Dean.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah.

Our next question or comment comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open.

Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst

Hey. Thanks. Two questions. Jill, last quarter you talked a little bit about the slightly slower expansion of seats in the commercial space.

Can you talk a little bit about what you saw this quarter? And then on the education side, Dean, would that just typical Q3 thing, back-to-school, etc., or because of COVID do you think there will be kind of follow-on or there will build-in impact Q4 and other quarters as kind of people kind of closed down again and school-home again, etc. Just talk to that dynamic a little bit? Thank you.

Jill Putman -- Chief Financial Officer

When it comes to our commercial device expansion, Q3 looks very similar to Q2 with the exception of at a little bit of a slower start to Q2 because of April. And now as we think about our Q4 pipeline and what we're seeing, we're actually starting to see a little bit of an expansion opportunity there, where there are some of those IT budgets that were frozen or delayed or may be restricted in some capacity because of cash constraints, starting to see some confidence to build back up with our commercial customer base. And so we're hoping to see a little bit of that free back up for us.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Hey, Raimo. On the education side, you're right, that, of course, the buying season for education is very heavily weighted toward June and July, which marks the fiscal year move for educators in the United States. And then also, of course, are preparing for the upcoming school year. And we saw those two months as being as strong as ever, this year.

But the difference this year was that the tail of the education buying season extended into September, much more aggressively than it had before. And there is a couple of reasons for that, one of which is simply the source for funding on those purchases often came through government programs, and sometimes you just took a little bit of work in order to get that going. We are seeing that that tail is extending even further into Q4, which is a little bit unusual compared to past years as well. I actually believe in the next couple of quarters we're going to see an unusual amount of education buying compared to past seasons through the winter.

And I think there are a few reasons for that. One is going to be because Jamf is more global than ever in education. And if you take a look, obviously, not all of them have the exact same buying season as we have here in the US. And we have some countries as I've already mentioned that are doing a national deployment of technology to students and they are still in the very early stages of those deployments.

So we're anticipating that that's going to continue beyond the normal education buying season. And in addition to that, it's really interesting but the pandemic has, as I mentioned a little bit earlier, has almost awake in some industries to the potential that technology can provide. So while some schools had shared technology programs, what they've done just in some isolated cases with the pandemic is realized the potential of one-to-one technology for students. For instance, the hand-raising capability that a student can do from home turns out.

That's pretty valuable in the classroom as well in order to get more students speaking up that they need help. So I think it's going to continue for a while. I think that we're going to see more education buying as a percent of our overall buying this winter than we've seen in past winters.

Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst

OK. Perfect. Congrats from me as well.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Absolutely.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.

Matt Hedberg -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Hey, guys. Congrats as well on the acceleration. A little bit of a follow-up to Raimo's question on the strength in education. Our school districts approaching their contracts this year differently with, obviously, elevated levels of at-home.

Or Dean as you suggest is it more a function like this could be the new normal, in other words, even if kids aren't at home, the use of iOS devices in school will sort of permanently be higher than maybe what it once was. Therefore, maybe the contracts are no different than maybe at elevated levels. But you wouldn't necessarily expect that the kind of sort of come bring their seats down, let's say at some point?

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

As far as the contracting goes, I think, a very common method of contracting is actually along with a leasing arrangement that they might have from Apple for the devices themselves. And it's very frequently actually that those leases are for multi-year periods and then they'll buy Jamf to use with them for that same period of time. So that is somewhat common to history, but this year, maybe we are even seeing it more than ever. And no, I don't think we'll ever see on a mass scale that schools go into reverse on the technology front.

I think now that they're leasing these devices for the next several years. That is going to be something that, like I said earlier, has awaken them to the potential. And there are things that you can now think about in education. Of course, we want kids ultimately in the classroom, but even the classroom environment can be helped.

We actually call it technology-enabled active learning, where students aren't just sitting through a lecture, but they're doing something. It's been proven that learning environments can be enhanced with that. And I think more schools are going to realize that. And then, of course, Matt, as you well know, even earlier this week, we might have had a Snow Day in Minnesota under normal circumstances and who knows perhaps snow days will be a thing of the past.

Matt Hedberg -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

I'm sure. If there is kid listening, they probably don't like to hear that, but maybe you're probably right. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, I think, you said Jamf Business Plan, which to me sounds like a bundled offering of multiple products. I'm just sort of curious is that the right way to think about that in terms of trying to sell sort of more products through a bundle into the basin, maybe make it easier to consume and price? Is that the right way to think about that?

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. We are seeing just a terrific early demand for both Jamf Connect and Jamf Protect. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks that just since the COVID outbreak, over 700 customers of Jamf Connect are new to that solution, over 200 customers of Jamf Protect, and this is the first year that we have the solution available. So what we're hearing from customers is they just want it to be easier to work with us and to buy those solutions and renew those solutions.

So we've come up with, you're right, a bundled offer called Jamf Business Plan, where we're putting Jamf Pro, Jamf Protect, Jamf Connect altogether for all of the users of devices, whether it'd be just Mac or whether it would be iOS as well, on a usage-based pricing offer. Super easy to buy super easy to renew just based on headcount.

Matt Hedberg -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

That's great. Well, I do see great opportunity to cross-sell. Great. That's it for me.

Thanks, guys. Congrats again.

Our next question or comment comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is open.

Gregg Moskowitz -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst

OK. Thank you very much. Hi, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter.

So a bit of a follow-up to Raimo's question. You added, in total 1.4 million devices under management this quarter. And I think that's the strongest quarterly performance for Jamf that we've ever seen. And I know that you don't, of course, guide to incremental devices under your management on a go-forward basis.

But it sounds like Dean that just following your comments, specifically around education and sort of the longer-tail that exists, it sounds like you don't sort of look at any kind of cliff event if you will, where you might see-now that we sort of exit this back-to-school period you might see this kind of material degradation and incremental unit. It sounds like the demand drivers seem pretty solid for a little while, but I just wanted to follow up on that.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Absolutely, I do not see what's happening right now as a pull-forward or a temporary action. I actually see it as more of an accelerator to what technology can be used for in the future. And a lot of organizations are thinking kind of differently about their spend. I mean, think about it this way.

Of course, we know the work at home and learn-from-home initiatives are igniting some of this activity. But some organizations are realizing, hey, you know what, we don't have to spend as much on travel as we have historically spent provided that people have excellent technology to where they don't have to travel, or maybe we don't have to grow our facilities as fast as we did before provided that people have an excellent technology environment that is their office at home. And then in many industries, as I mentioned as well, in order to be safe and stay open should whatever happens in the future, put technology between the customer and the consumer, between the teacher and the student, between the patient and the doctor, between the store retailer and the shopper. You can go through industry-by-industry and realize how not only would that help keep people safe and help keep organizations open, but it will actually make those organizations more efficient in the long run, and I believe that what we've experienced in the last six months has really shown organizations that.

Gregg Moskowitz -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst

And then just as a follow-up, getting back to JNUC, which, by the way, was one of the best virtual conference introduction I've seen. And I know the number of attendees that you talked about was much higher than usual, but, of course, there is no physical interaction, right. And so I'm just curious if you've seen any change in the top of funnel versus what you typically experience after this event. Thanks.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks a lot, Gregg. And I appreciate the compliment and we're so proud of what our marketing team put together. But it's really an entire company event. I would remind you that the core purpose of JNUC is to be an educational event where Apple admins can collaborate and learn.

And this year was no different. We didn't want it to be a marketing event. We wanted it to be an education event. However, what we did discover is when you take cost and travel out of the equation, we are able to see exactly how many people really want to come to JNUC.

And as we mentioned was approximately 20,000 attendees, 10 times what typically is, with 28% of them being prospects. So while it's an education event, yes, some people come to plan their future investments. We've already seen leads come out of it. And we're expecting more of that activity because of the very large attendance that we had.

Gregg Moskowitz -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst

Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of David Hynes from Canaccord. Your line is open.

David Hynes -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst

Hey, Dean and Jill. Congrats on the nice quarter. Dean, maybe I could ask one about Protect. You noted a nice win with SAP.

I think it's been a customer for a while. So I guess, I'm curious kind of what was the catalyst to get SAP to kind of act and take on Protect? What's the early feedback been from them? And then when you talk about 28,000 Protect licenses, is that just a portion of their Mac base? Is there still an opportunity to grow there? Just kind of how are they thinking about the rollout?

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks for joining and thanks for the question. So two questions there. One is just about SAP's rollout. And yeah, they've been pretty open that they're up to about 28,000 Mac.

And that is their Mac fleet. But SAP continues to grow their Mac fleet every year. As do so many of our customers as Mac continues to gain popularity within the enterprise. And especially with Apple's announcements this week, we do not see that going away anytime soon as a matter of fact we see especially with the announcements this week.

And today's general availability of Big Sur, we think that that is going to continue to grow. When it comes to feedback on protect, there have been some really terrific testimonials that have come in that I'm sure our marketing team will get busy on making sure that we make that information public. But the biggest thing that we've noted with our early installations is that our customers have been putting Jamf Protect out there for their Macs. And almost instantly finding things that they wish they would have known about those Macs that the past security software that was, let's face it, predominantly Windows-focused, simply didn't find.

And this is because we look specifically for Mac exploits whether their behaviors or whether it'd be malware because of our Apple-specific focus, they are finding things on their Macs that they wish they would have known ahead of time. And the user experience is still excellent because we actually have an architected for Mac solution.

David Hynes -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst

And then maybe a follow-up on the healthcare segment, which I don't think we've talked about. Yeah, just the dynamics there, I'm curious, when you land a customer in that segment do you tend to land more expanded? In other words, is a hospital system typically like hey we're in Apple organizations, so you get a bunch of devices upfront, or is there still that device penetration story that we might see kind of play out more in the enterprise market?

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

It's the latter. It is not a go in and win all devices, all types on the very first day. As a matter of fact almost more so in healthcare occurs over time because it's very frequent that let's face it. For healthcare providers out there, if they have Mac, they are more than likely using Jamf already.

And so it will be a step forward to say, hey, I've heard of what Jamf's doing either with clinical communication or patient bedside or Virtual visits. I think I would like to try that in a pilot. And then they roll out in a pilot. After that, they might roll it out to an entire ward, after that maybe an entire hospital.

And then, of course, many integrated healthcare networks have many hospitals under their management, so they'll roll out hospital by hospital. So health is very frequently a start smaller and just continues to grow the industry.

David Hynes -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst

Interesting. OK. Great. Thanks for the color.

Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Pat Walravens from JMP Securities. Your line is open.

Pat Walravens -- JMP Securities -- Analyst

Oh, great. Thank you, and congratulations. So one question for each of you if that's OK. Dean, first, I enjoyed your conversation with Jeremy Butcher on Jamf Nation.

And between that and the fact that it's been six months since Apple bought Fleetsmith, I just wonder if there is anything new that you've learned about their thinking behind that acquisition. I know that's something that some investors were worried about.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Sure. Thanks, Pat, and I'll pass on your thoughts to our good friend Jeremy at Apple. The short answer is no. There has really been nothing more significant that has happened around that acquisition hasn't changed the competitive dynamic at all.

And the way that our viewpoint of it in the last earnings call and our viewpoint of it several months ago, when we first talked about, it is the same as it is today anything that increases Apple's usage in the enterprise is great news for Jamf. And we don't really compete with that particular solution at all, and that we believe it's ultimately going to be used, and those talented individuals are going to be used at Apple just to continue to strengthen Apple's cloud services that Jamf will then be able to leverage to build stronger solutions for our customers.

Pat Walravens -- JMP Securities -- Analyst

And then, Jill, I know you very clearly have not guided to it. But I'm just wondering if there's any thoughts you would want to share with investors about things they ought to think about when they look at 2021?

Jill Putman -- Chief Financial Officer

And no. Clearly, we have not guided to '21 when we have. But I think the thing we can think about is this is an unusual year. So as we exit this year, we're going to have a different exit rate than we maybe would have had on our expense base.

But our revenues are right in line with where we are expecting them to be as we exited the year. We'll continue to invest at rates that were very similar to kind of, you think about our pre-COVID expense investment levels, particularly on the go-to-market energy and where we put dollars there and continuing to invest at a rate very consistent with prior periods in that we still -- we're early in our opportunity in the TAM. And so we've got a lot of customers to go and grab, and so we'll continue to spend there. And then also continuing to expand or invest at a similar rate in R&D as we continue to innovate on both of our existing and new technologies.

And then probably the only thing that will be slightly different next year is, of course, it will be our first full year as a public company. So we'll have some incremental spend in our G&A and back-office functions there.

Pat Walravens -- JMP Securities -- Analyst

OK. Great. Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Rob Owens from Piper Sandler. Your line is open sir.

Rob Owens -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst

Great. In under the wire. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Dean, you have something little bit in some of your comments.

But with Apple drops major operating systems and hardware updates, what's been performance your business historically? Have you ever seen a step function associated with that, or is this just driving more consumerization, so it's more of a longer-term momentum opportunity?

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Thanks a lot for the question. And this is a big week. It's actually a terrific week.

For those that watched the Apple event earlier this week, not only is the new Mac operating system Big Sur available today but earlier this week, Apple announced that probably the biggest move with the Mac that they've made in a very, very long time where the new MacBooks with the M1 chip are coming available. And really of all the Apple Enterprise Management providers that are out there, only Jamf was here. The last time Apple did something like this when they moved from the PowerPC chip back in 2005 to Intel. And we helped organizations through that.

But as you can imagine, not every single Mac within an enterprise is going to move all on the same day. For a Mac for a couple of years, you're going to have enterprises that have a mix of Intel Macs and M1 chip Macs. And nobody has a larger Mac inventory than does Jamf, and nobody can get to information on the Mac's better than Jamf. And as a result, we're going to be able to help with policy management and security and those types of things for the next couple of years for organizations.

And of course, the thing that really distinguishes Jamf is that, while there are companies out there right now saying they're nervous about their customers upgrading to Big Sur, Jamf is a matter of fact, there are Jamf's all around the world today, upgrading to Big Sur without concern because we just know that we're going to work with it. In addition to that, the same goes for the processor. Again, a little anecdotal story on that. And this will kind of reflect what will-why we tend to do well when these changes occur is, I bought my MacBook Air with the M1 chip five minutes after that Apple event was over.

I didn't need to call anybody in IT or anybody in security to find out whether it was OK or whether it would work within our organization. I will get it within a couple of weeks delivered to my home. I'll power it up and I will enroll it in management connection and protection at Jamf, and I will be up and running with all my data from my prior Mac and with all access and security applied inside a 30-minute to moment as to blip. And nobody from IT will be involved and nobody from IT will help me.

That is just a new world of enterprise operations that very few people exist in. And the more organizations we can show that kind of simplicity to, the more Mac adoption with Jamf will grow within the enterprise.

Rob Owens -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst

Perfect. And then regarding some of your earlier channel comments, are there enough channel partners out of scale within the Apple ecosystem to truly drive channel leverage? And if so, what you kind of take on your partners that more opportunistic on more of 1G, 2G basis? Thanks.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

I mean, well, there are obviously some major channel partners out there because, of course, as you know, in the enterprise Apple devices sell entirely through the channel. And so those organizations, a lot of times organizations just want to have their management in security and access controls purchased right along with the devices, and so they'll go on one order form into these large resellers. Of course, we're also going to have regional resellers around the world going to market, but it's a mix. In total, Jamf's have got hundreds of resellers that we work with.

But of course, we've got the top five or six that represent a very good chunk of the selling.

Operator

Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Dean Hager for any closing remarks.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Sure. Thanks, everybody, for joining today. We really appreciated the questions. I'm so proud of what the Jamf team members have accomplished in Q3.

And we look forward to continue to help organizations succeed with Apple in the future, no matter what the future holds. Now go out there and buy your new MacBook with the M1 chip. You won't regret it. Stay safe and be well.

Is Now a Good Time to Build an ESG Portfolio?,Motley Fool,6 days ago,"The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft and recommends the following options: long January 2021 $85 calls on Microsoft, ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/esg-investing/2020/11/12/is-now-a-good-time-to-build-an-esg-portfolio/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","The financial community has been abuzz about ESG funds, which have shown a surprising level of strength in recent years. And now, with a President-elect who supports sustainability waiting in the wings, the time could be right to build out a broader ESG portfolio -- as long as you understand the risks.

A bright ESG outlook

It wasn't too long ago that you didn't have the option to build a well-diversified ESG portfolio. You might have held a clean energy fund out of principle, but you also had to own positions that rated lower on ESG factors just to have a sufficient level of diversification.

Not so today. The ESG fund space has grown dramatically in recent years to the point that it may check all the boxes on your portfolio's target asset allocations -- including emerging markets, international developed markets, domestic large and mid caps, real estate, and domestic and international fixed income.

And now, with President-elect Joe Biden on his way to the White House, ESG investing will likely continue to flourish as it benefits from a more favorable regulatory environment going forward. As a starting point, Biden is expected to rejoin the Paris climate deal and reenact federal initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. More than that, Biden and running mate Kamala Harris are also likely to enact policies that go beyond the ""E"" in ESG, policies that encourage responsible corporate social and governance practices as well.

What happens next

While analysts largely agree that ESG funds will do well under a Biden-Harris administration, there's always the question of what happens next. Yes, Biden and Harris will likely swing the regulatory pendulum to support sustainability. But that pendulum could very well swing back the other way in four or eight years. It could even happen at the hands of Donald Trump, who's rumored to be considering a run at the 2024 election.

If you are investing for the long haul, it's always risky to overhaul your portfolio based on a four-year window of opportunity. Once you start making investing decisions based on who's in the White House, it becomes difficult to stop. You could find yourself in a perpetual state of trying to predict what will happen under this administration or the next. That's not a good place to be, emotionally or financially. You'll end up riding a stress rollercoaster every four years and, if you act on your predictions, you might inadvertently lower your investment returns, too.

Take a measured approach

If sustainability is important to you, it's appropriate to increase your exposure to companies with strong ESG initiatives and track records, either directly or through ESG funds, with a caveat. You're not making these moves as a strategy to get rich while Biden is president -- you're making them because they're right for you long term. You can stick to the long-term approach by remaining disciplined about how you choose your ESG positions.

When selecting individual stocks, for example, evaluate the business model, leadership team, industry dynamics, financial strength, and cash flow, in addition to the ESG ratings.

To evaluate ESG funds, take care to understand the fund's screening process. The presence of ESG, clean energy, or sustainability in the fund's name doesn't mean much. Dig in and find out how companies are selected for the portfolio. Review the holdings carefully, too, to ensure you aren't overexposed to companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. These are popular in both ESG and traditional funds. Check the fund's performance history and also put your eyes on the expense ratio. Expenses for ESG funds can be on the high side relative to traditional funds.

Finally, don't overlook diversification. Focusing your investing on the ESG space naturally limits your diversification. That's not to say you should invest in ExxonMobil to counter that, but just make sure your holdings are spread appropriately across individual companies, asset classes, and even geographies.

Focus on the long term

Building out a broader ESG portfolio may be the right move from the standpoint of your worldview and values. Make sure it's also the right financial move by staying diversified and also disciplined in your selection process. You certainly want to benefit from ESG investing in the short term, but your decisions have to make long-term sense, too.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.756, 'pos': 0.244, 'compound': 0.4404}]","[{'neg': 0.095, 'neu': 0.654, 'pos': 0.252, 'compound': 0.4215}]","[{'neg': 0.095, 'neu': 0.654, 'pos': 0.252, 'compound': 0.4215}]",0.4215,0.4404,0.4215,0.42779999999999996,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive
"What Is a Pure-Play REIT, and Is One Right for You?",Motley Fool,6 days ago,"On the other hand, Apple Hospitality REIT (NYSE: APLE) is a pure play on midlevel hotel real estate. And National Retail Properties (NYSE: NNN) is a pure play ...",https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-investing/articles/what-is-a-pure-play-reit-and-is-one-right-for-you/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Real estate investment trusts (REITs) generally specialize in a certain type of commercial property, but that doesn't mean they only invest in their core property type. For example, many office REITs also have some retail space in their portfolio. Some indoor mall REITs also have some shopping center assets.

Companies that invest exclusively in a certain type of asset are referred to as pure plays. For example, a pure-play shopping center REIT would only own shopping centers and no other kinds of assets.

Pure-play vs. 'focused' REIT examples

As mentioned, many REITs focus on a specific property type. For example, Ryman Hospitality Properties (NYSE: RHP) primarily owns group-focused hotels, Realty Income's (NYSE: O) focus is on freestanding retail properties, and Empire State Realty Trust (NYSE: ESRT) largely owns urban office space.

But none of these are pure plays. In addition to its hotels, Ryman gets a small portion of its revenue from entertainment venues like the Grand Ole Opry. About 15% of Realty Income's portfolio is made up of office, industrial, and agricultural properties. And like many urban office REITs, Empire State Realty Trust has significant exposure to retail real estate, plus it owns and operates the observatory on top of the Empire State Building.

On the other hand, Apple Hospitality REIT (NYSE: APLE) is a pure play on midlevel hotel real estate. And National Retail Properties (NYSE: NNN) is a pure play on single-tenant retail.

Advantages and disadvantages to pure-play REITs

The main reason to consider a pure-play REIT over one with multiple property types is for a narrow focus. If a company is very good at evaluating, operating, developing, and managing a certain type of property, it can be a net benefit to investors for management to stick to their core competence rather than trying to branch out and create multiple income streams. For example, if National Retail Properties were to announce it was going to start buying medical office buildings, it would negatively affect my opinion of it, since the REIT has such an excellent track record in its core property type.

On the other hand, the downside to a pure-play REIT is the same thing as its key advantage: a laser focus on a single type of commercial real estate. This can be a disadvantage in tough times. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Realty Income's industrial and office properties helped offset the effects of retail closures.

The Millionacres bottom line

There's no perfect answer to the ""pure-play or diversified"" debate, and it depends on the REIT. In my own portfolio, I own some pure plays and some with two or more property types in their portfolio. The bottom line is that a pure play REIT can be an excellent way to invest if the management team is very good at generating superior returns from a single type of property and you're prepared to ride out any cyclicality that comes with such a narrow investment focus. But it's important to evaluate REITs on a case-by-case basis -- a solid, well-run operation is far more important as a long-term investor than a narrow or diversified business focus.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.741, 'pos': 0.259, 'compound': 0.6808}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.806, 'pos': 0.194, 'compound': 0.34}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.741, 'pos': 0.259, 'compound': 0.6808}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.806, 'pos': 0.194, 'compound': 0.34}]",0.5104,0.0,0.5104,0.34026666666666666,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive

This video was recorded on Nov. 9, 2020.

Chris Hill: It's Monday, November 9th. Welcome to MarketFoolery. I'm Chris Hill, with me today, Mr. Bill Barker. Thanks for being here.

Bill Barker: Thanks for having me.

Hill: It is a big day in the market. You know, it was already looking good Sunday night, the Dow futures were up on the news that, in case you missed it, while votes are still being counted, Joe Biden will become the 46th President of the United States. And that was Sunday night, things were looking good, and this morning [laughs] we got the news that Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, which is in Phase III trials is more than 90% effective in participants who were not previously infected. And I suppose that should be expected, that news has set off all kinds of ripple effects [laughs] across the market. The S&P 500 hit a new high this morning. Airline stocks, hotel and travel stocks, cruise lines, theme parks all up more than 10%. We're going to get to the stay-at-home stocks in a minute, but what do you see, like, what goes through your mind when you see all of these categories of stocks, broadly, as a group rising at once?

Barker: The first thing you see is a lot of stuff that's up dramatically today and then you need to go back and see how they've done over the whole course of the year, and to be reminded that up 20% today doesn't mean these things are close to, in some cases, getting back to where they started the year at before COVID was there. So, in terms of a quick snapshot, it may look like there's some overreaction, but in the longer term, I don't think so.

Hill: Just one of those stocks that I think fits that category of what you just described is AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), which is the largest movie theater chain in the world. Shares are up 60% today. And you look at that and you think, oh, my goodness! And then you, as you indicated, you sort of back out a little bit and you say, oh, it's still down 50% for the year, which [laughs] in a normal year you'd think, oh, my goodness! What is happening to this stock?

Some of these moves, however, seem not crazy to me, they seem reasonable. Marriott, in particular, Marriott is just one of those hotel operators that has been, I don't know, I just sort of look at Marriott and even three months ago I thought to myself, I'm pretty sure Marriott is coming out of this OK on the other side, because at some point we get the vaccine. So, some of what I'm seeing in hotel and travel, Booking Holdings, Expedia, you know, the rise that we're seeing in those shares today makes sense to me.

The cruise lines, and I don't mean to pick on the cruise lines, but the cruise lines I'm less bullish on those as businesses than I am the airlines.

Barker: Okay, yeah. Well, they are less critical than the airlines. Now, unlike some of these things, I don't see the obvious competition over the long term to what cruises offer, i.e., the movie theater chains, and we've talked about this, there's really significant competition from what you can experience at home, the better, larger, clearer TV sets. The extremely good value proposition of what you're getting from something like Netflix versus going out to a movie theater and seeing one movie, especially, in a family. So, I think that AMC has, sort of, gotten partially up off of the floor, having been left for dead, it's got its last gasp, maybe better than that, maybe not, today. But you see where the competition is and has been for several years, and this sped things up, but the fact that it looks very good today that we'll have a vaccine and people will be able to go to theaters, doesn't change maybe the next 10-year trajectory for them.

Cruises, I would say, I don't see how they're going to be Netflix out of existence. Airlines, of course, are necessary, fundamental, don't have a great history of return to shareholders but certainly as soon as it is safe in everybody's mind to fly again, they're going to start flying, both to catch up on all the vacations that they wanted to be taking right now. I think a lot of work travel is going to go away to a degree that, you know, Zoom has replaced the need for a lot of that face-to-face stuff. So, different long-term projections, of course, for every single one of these industries, but they're all back to life today.

Hill: One more group that we haven't mentioned yet that's back to life, at least in terms of the stocks, mall-based retail, Macy's, Nordstrom, Kohl's, all up more than 10% today. Simon Property Group is going to report after the bell today, and the last time I looked this morning, the stock was up 20%.

Barker: This is not going to come fast enough to save a mall-based Christmas, i.e., the timeline for people actually having a vaccine under the best-case scenario, in large numbers, is going to be the second quarter of next year. But there will be a time in the middle of next year where I think that malls see significantly more traffic than they're seeing today. Again, I think it just falls into, hey, how was the future looking for malls 12 months ago? Not great. You know, more and more purchases are going online. That sped up. Malls will get to have a second act once people are gathering in large numbers indoors again, but the competition over the longer timeframe still you got to say malls have got a lot, a lot of competition coming at them.

Hill: On the flipside, some of the stay-at-home stocks, the ripple effect for them is, of course, a negative one, Zoom Video, Peloton, just two of the stocks down more than 10% today. Although, you know, I feel like the same thing is true just in the opposite form [laughs] of what you said, where it's like, OK, I get that Peloton and Zoom Video have had really good runs in 2020. I suppose, if I were a short-term trader, maybe I'll be making this trade too, do we really feel like the future for these two businesses is significantly darker than it was a day ago? I don't know, like, on some level, part of me looks at everything that's happening today and I'm not doing any transacting today, but one of my thoughts is, hey, everybody seems to be acting like it's a big surprise that there's a vaccine. It's like, didn't we all know they were working on a vaccine? Like, we knew this day was coming at some point, didn't we?

Barker: Yeah, we did know something was coming. And look, the data that is out so far today, and it's still incomplete, but it is better than even the optimists were hoping for in terms of 90%, better than 90%, they're actually rounding down to 90%, Pfizer is, from what I understand, based on not wanting to oversell this. So, it's maybe even beyond the high-end of what you could have optimistically been hoping for. The timeline was basically, comfortably in the optimistic, but realistic timeline. And there still may be some pickups in between now and when this all really goes away.

Look, there was the premarket 300 Dow point-ish Biden Presidency move that was expected, as of premarket late-last night. And then this is both the optimistic stuff we were hoping for, and the better than optimistic. So, it's all good today, isn't it?

Hill: Ironically though, shares of Pfizer up 5%, 6%. [laughs]

Barker: Sleepy year, get to work, guys, get to work, do something. [laughs] This stock has been flat for the year. It was $39.20 at the close of 2019, it's $39.70, $39.80, $39.90, something like that at the moment. Come on! What do you... get to work. [laughs]

Hill: [laughs] You're chastising people at Pfizer.

Barker: [laughs] Well, this is the problem. This is the problem with extracting stories from stock moves, at times, it's phenomenal work. They're taking cautious victory laps out there today, very thrilled with the data that they have in hand right now, while continuing to say that there are additional steps, and these are necessary and that the process is the way it is to, you know, have the safe outcomes that we expect out of our healthcare system. So, a great year for actual performance in terms of the stock, you know, it's not your best-performing stock [laughs] this year, but the stuff that is the best-performing stuff this year is having the weakest day today.

Hill: Let's move on to some of the earnings news. Shares of McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) hovering in the +1% or -1% today. McDonald's had a good third quarter report, profits were higher than expected, revenue looked good, same-store sales in the United States were up a little more than 4.5%. Not that I thought that these results were going to set the stock on fire, but I thought there'd be -- you know, this coupled with the news of the vaccine, I thought we'd see a little bit more boost in McDonald's shares this morning.

Barker: Well, yeah, maybe give it a little bit more than a day, as people are getting more excited about buying up the stuff that had been beaten down much more than McDonald's had been. So, in terms of, let's go value shopping today, it's not attracting quite the same amount of interest. But, yeah, very normal looking numbers. If this was a report that came out and you had not been around for any of 2020. So, you know, comps 4.6% in the U.S., weaker globally, but earnings pretty good. All the numbers, all the percentages, up-or-down look comfortably in what you're used to seeing in other contexts. It's not the +120% growth that most COVID-benefited stocks have seen. It's not -30% as some of the second quarter results were for some industries. So, longer term, the only interesting thing here is the McPlant news.

Hill: I was going to say, if there's not a big reaction in McDonald's shares, shares of Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) falling close to 10% this morning on the news that in 2021 McDonald's is coming out with a plant-based burger of their own.

Barker: Have you had any of these plant-based burgers?

Hill: Not burgers, no, I had the Dunkin' breakfast sandwich, the beyond sandwich.

Barker: Are you a buyer?

Hill: Well, I bought that one time. [laughs]

Barker: [laughs] Well, they've continued to offer it, have they not?

Hill: They have continued to offer it. I think I may have said on the show before that the problem -- so, the Beyond Sausage in the breakfast sandwich at Dunkin', very good, very tasty, good texture, like, pretty much everything I'm looking for [laughs] out of that ingredient. It was the rest of it, it was on this English muffin which was one of those things that reminds people like me that Dunkin' is really good at donuts, but when it comes to other bread-based, sort of, flour-based breakfast pastries and sandwiches that kind of think, yeah, they're not good with English muffins or the bagels, so. But the Beyond Sausage was good.

Barker: Throw that plant-based sausage between a couple of donuts, is that what you're saying, start with that one?

Hill: I'm saying, like, run out to the grocery store just [laughs] buy some English muffins and just let someone else do the work.

Barker: Well so, getting back to McDonald's, obviously, they've got an enormous base of sales that they're going to be able to deliver. And if they're producing their own McPlant, and not either requiring the ingredients from Beyond, and now offering a competition to Beyond, and ultimately maybe providing some of that to others. Yeah, not great news for beyond, although they've had a pretty good time of it, so it's their turn to get a little bit of a, you know, decline in their price.

Hill: Last Friday after the market closed, Berkshire Hathaway released its third quarter report. And for the second quarter in a row the headline is, Warren Buffett buying back his own stock. This time it was a record $9 billion worth of shares. And Berkshire Hathaway, that stock up 5%, 6% today.

Barker: Yeah, up 5%, 6%, like a lot of other things. So, I think buying back the shares, that comes out at a good time, but another, sort of, weak-ish year for the stock. They are going into the day, down almost 8%, so this gets you back to close to where the year started and underperforming the S&P, obviously, as it has for several years. They've got a lot of old economy industries in the conglomerate, and those are going to wake back up quite a bit more in a COVID vaccine era, but still there's not that terribly much to get excited about here. It's going to look more like the S&P 500 than not at most times.

Hill: Let me ask you a completely unfair question. [laughs] Do you think that Warren Buffett's lieutenants left to their own devices, and I know they have their own portfolios, but like, if they basically had complete control, do you think they're doing more buying of other stocks in the past three months than what we just saw from Buffett and Charlie Munger?

I know it's an unfair question, I'm asking you to speculate in a manner that is completely unreasonable, and yet, I asked it anyway.

Barker: Yeah. So, I agree with you that it's unfair and that any answer that I would give [laughs] is probably worthless. That said, I would hope so, right? I would hope that the guys that they've got in are looking at things with different eyes than Munger and Buffett. And that they have found people whose skills complement Buffett and Munger, because they've got their routines down, and Buffett's evolved somewhat, you know, having made the major purchases of Apple that he's made. But you would hope that they're not looking for clones of what they themselves have perfected in a different era.

Hill: All right. Let me ask you a much more reasonable and fair question, have you had any plant-based burgers? Like, I'm just trying to think ahead to 2021, you know, if I really wanted to go out of my way, I could find a Burger King and buy an Impossible Whopper or something like that, like, I don't know, I realize that people like me are the market and I'm not interested, but I'm curious if you've ever gone down this road before?

Barker: No. I mean, it's not something that I've taken a stand against, it's just never, and I see more and more of that choice in the grocery store next to the stuff that I'm actually buying. So, it's in eyesight more and more, and I'm sure I will try it within the next year or two. Why not? It might be good and it's probably going to be better in the near future than it is today. I haven't ever heard anybody tell me, oh, my God! You got to try this, it's just as good, right? Nobody has ever said that to me. And at the point at which that occurs, I might go full in. Because if I were allowed to eat all of the red meat that I want to eat, [laughs] well, I probably wouldn't be around for very long, so there's that. So, I'm hoping that there's a reason for me to hear that this is phenomenal and I have to eat all the plant-based burgers that I can, because I'll be there.

Hill: You and I have said this to one another for years that at some point down the road if the doctor comes to either one of us and says, you know, I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do at this point, you have three to six months and that's going to be it and we'll try to make you as comfortable as possible. One of our reactions is going to be, well, OK, [laughs] it's time to eat all the bacon I can get my hands on. And I bring this up because of the passing of someone who has been in our homes for +30 years and was a delight, and that's Alex Trebek, the passing of Alex Trebek. And if anyone missed any of the tributes over the weekend on social media or obituaries, just one of those things that reaffirms my faith in humanity, one of those, like, oh, he appears to be every bit as good a person by all accounts as was projected on the television screen. Although, among other things, it did give me the opportunity to explain to my teenagers the Saturday Night Live version of Jeopardy! where Alex Trebek, when it was Celebrity Jeopardy, he was just tolerating, just barely hanging on, Will Ferrell, [laughs] as Alex Trebek just tolerating really, really dumb guests, Burt Reynolds, Sean Connery and others.

Barker: Sean Connery also having passed in the last week or week-and-a-half, whatever it is now that -- yeah, I saw somebody connect those two dots on a Twitter post. And it is something that all children should be exposed to, the Saturday Night Live Jeopardy! and the Black Jeopardy! that they've done more recently, which is also a good comedy. And Trebek, yeah, people were falling all over themselves to bring up stories, if they had them, of personal interactions with him or knowledge of things that he had done or the effects that he had had on their lives. So, it was really nice to see that kind of universal acclaim for not just his work but his life.

Hill: Hopefully he, you know, just thought of Warren Zevon whose advice in the [laughs] last days of his life was to enjoy every sandwich. [laughs] So, hopefully Alex got to do that down the homestretch. Boy! This is a melancholy way to end the show. Sorry about that.

Barker: Yeah, go back to stock prices, they're up a billion points right now. [laughs] Everybody who own stocks is phenomenally happy at things, and many, many, many, many people are happy with the election results, including the market, which got, I think, the seemingly Republican Senate element of the outcome of the election, still to be determined by the runoffs in Georgia, but the odds are favorable that it'll either be a Republican majority. Even if it were to be a 50:50 split, I don't think that that would be the kind of mandate where the corporate tax increase that was part of the Biden tax proposal could really be likely pulled off. So, that's something that the market is kind of wallowing in as well today.

Hill: Well. And to go back to the stocks for a second, I mean, this is why we constantly talk about having a diversified portfolio, because if you've got Zoom Video in your portfolio and Peloton, and you also have Disney and Starbucks, it's like, all right, there have been points during the year where Peloton and Zoom Video were carrying the day for you, today it's the reverse, it's Disney and Starbucks that are boosting your portfolio, while stocks like Zoom Video on Peloton take a little bit of a haircut. But again, all the more reason to diversify as much as you can.

Barker: Yeah. No, it's a good day for value investors, and they have not had terribly many of them this year. But if you look at the, sort of, style box chart of returns, small caps is I think the first new high for Russell 2000, the best-known small cap index, in over two years. And so, you know, the number of new highs last year and this year for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 is out of all proportion to the rest of the market. And that's nice that small cap investors have finally got their money back, if they put something down in August of 2018 there, they're back to even.

Hill: Bill Barker, always good talking to you. Thanks for being here.

Barker: Thanks for having me.

Hill: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

Eric Li -- Chief Investor Relations and Public Relations Officer

Thank you, Mark, and thank you everybody for joining us. My name is Eric Li, and I'm the Chief IR/PR Officer. Joining me today are Jordan Wu, our CEO and Jessica Pan, our CFO.

On today's call, we will first review the Himax consolidated financial performance for the third quarter followed by the fourth quarter 2020 outlook. Jordan will then give an update on the status of our business. After which, we will take questions. We will review our financials on both IFRS and non-IFRS basis. The non-IFRS financials exclude share-based compensation and acquisition-related charges. In addition to impact of COVID-19, which remained harsh in many parts of the world, the prolonged U.S. China trade tension brought turbulence to the market and resulted in new market dynamic during the third quarter.

The unceasing stay at home economic created new demand, but pushed foundry capacity constraint to a more severe level. Despite these challenges, we continued to ask you efficiently and delivered strong business results in the changing environment. We pre-announced preliminary key financial results for the third quarter on October 6 for the revenue, gross margin and the EPS, all exceeding the guidance issued on August 6, 2020. Today, our reported results for revenue, gross margin and the EPS are all in line with the pre-announced results.

For the third quarter, we recorded net revenue of $239.9 million, an increase of 28.3% sequentially and an increase of 46.1% compared to the same period last year. The 28.3% sequential increase of revenue exceeded our guidance of an increase of around 20% quarter-over-quarter. Display driver of TV, tablet, smartphone and automotive as well as CMOS image sensors, all contributed better than guided sales.

Gross margin was 22.3%, exceeding the prior guidance of flat to slightly down from 21% of the second quarter. IFRS profit per diluted ADS was $0.049, exceeding our guidance of around $0.02 to $0.028. Strong sales and improved gross margin contributed to the better than expected earnings results. The EPS increase was, however, offset by the RSU expense, which was higher than what we were -- was indicated on the last earnings call, but we raised the RSU amount to reward the team for the better than expected financial results. We will elaborate on this in few minutes. Non-IFRS profit per diluted ADS was $0.073, exceeding our guidance of around $0.035 to $0.043.

Revenue from large display drivers was $55.7 million, down 6.3% sequentially and up 11.3% year-over-year. The sequential decline was driven by significantly lower shipments of monitor ICs due to customers' inventory correction, following a demand hike in the first half. If combining the first three quarters of 2020, our sales into monitor segment still increased 22.1% from last year. The demand for monitors remains robust and we expect a strong rebound in the fourth quarter.

Offsetting monitor's third quarter weakness was the surge in TV and notebook sales. TV segment revenue increased 17.6% sequentially, reflecting strong consumer spending and home entertainment demand. Panel makers' building of inventories in anticipation of higher TV panel prices also contributed to the sequential increase. It was no surprise that notebook sales recorded the highest growth among large display products, increasing 31.5% quarter-over-quarter, thanks to the continuing demand for telework and e-learning with panel customers seemingly still sitting on low inventories. Large panel driver ICs accounted for 23.2% of total revenues for the quarter compared to 31.8% in the second quarter of 2020 and 30.5% a year ago.

Small and medium-sized display drivers recorded a very strong third quarter, with revenues of $151.6 million, up 53.5% sequentially and up 96.6% year-over-year. TDDIs for both tablet and smartphone posted extraordinary sales growth in Q3. For the automotive segment, we delivered a decent low-teens sequential growth amid a declining automotive market worldwide. Small and medium-sized segment accounted for 63.2% of total sales for the quarter compared to 52.8% in the second quarter of 2020 and 46.9% a year ago.

Our smartphone sales, the best performing product category of all in Q3, reached a quarterly record high of $63.3 million, up 153.6% sequentially and 101.2% year-over-year. It represented more than 26% of our total sales in Q3. Our smartphone TDDI sales were up 155.7% sequentially and up 193.7% from the same period last year. The significant sequential growth was a continuation from Q2 when the product category already grew 69% from the previous quarter. However, as mentioned in our last earnings call, the growth was capped by an industrywide wafer foundry shortage. Our smartphone and tablet TDDI ICs share the same pool of foundry capacity, and we were, and still are, unable to meet all the demands for these products.

The Q3 strength in smartphone TDDI reflected customers' aggressive new product launch plans with our TDDI solutions as well as our ability to price our products higher to reflect the tight wafer foundry situation. Amid the economic downturn and lackluster overall smartphone consumption, OEMs are pushing more for budget handsets using TFT-LCD screens, instead of more expensive AMOLED displays. Sales of traditional smartphone DDICs also surged by 147.8% sequentially and were up 5.3% from same period last year with demands from key brand customers. We believes such strong sales of traditional smartphone DDICs were a short-term rebound as the product category is quickly being replaced by TDDI and AMOLED, as we have repeatedly indicated.

Revenue for tablet posted a third consecutive record high, with Q3 sales growing 26% sequentially and 336.4% year-over-year. The quarterly revenue reached $53.7 million, accounting for more than 25% of our driver IC revenue. We expect our tablet segment sales to continue to grow as overall market demand for tablet remains robust for more home working and online education needs, and TDDI's penetration in tablet market continues to pick up.

Our tablet TDDI has a leading market position at a time when TDDI is quickly becoming mainstream for Android tablets. Third quarter tablet TDDI sales increased over 35% sequentially and were better than our guidance of a 20% increase. This marked the second consecutive quarter of increase in tablet TDDI shipments since the initial mass production in the first quarter of 2020, and we are firmly in the leading position among peers.

However, as mentioned above, the sequential growth was crippled by tight foundry capacity as we couldn't ship enough to meet all customer demands. Revenue of traditional discrete driver ICs for tablet also delivered 20.3% sequential growth and was up 164.5% year-over-year in the third quarter, thanks to strong orders from both leading brand and white box names.

Our third quarter driver IC revenue for automotive was up 13.2% sequentially and up 3.9% year-over-year, despite a sluggish global automotive market. The sequential growth was owed, to a large extent, to the aggressive pursuit of market share gains by China panel maker customers, to which we are a major supplier. These customers are comfortable with Himax leading technology and proven production record which supports them in their efforts to ramp up production swiftly. With global automotive demand showing signs of recovery, we expect to see robust and sustainable growth in Q4 and into 2021. Jordan will elaborate on this in few minutes.

Third quarter revenue from our non-driver businesses was $32.6 million, up 13.3% sequentially, but down 12.1% year-over-year. The sequential increase was mainly a result of higher engineering fee income and increased shipments of the Tcon for higher frame rate and high resolution displays as well as CMOS image sensor products with demand coming from notebook and IP camera applications. However, the increase in sales was offset by a decrease in WLO shipments to anchor customers. Non-driver products accounted for 13.6% of total revenue as compared to 15.4% in the second quarter of 2020 and 22.6% a year ago.

Gross margin for the third quarter was 22.3%, up 130 basis points sequentially and up 280 basis points from the same period last year. The sequential increase was contributed by a favorable product mix of more shipments of better margin products such as tablet and automotive ICs, higher engineering fee income and resales of certain products whose values have been written-off previously in accordance with our inventory management protocol.

Weighing on gross margins were lower WLO shipments, which decreased factory utilization, and increased shipments for smartphone ICs, which registered a lower gross margin than corporate average. Gross margin increased 2.8% from last year, thanks to a more favorable product mix with more shipments of tablet and Tcon, higher engineering fee income and resale of written-off products. Likewise, the gain was offset by lower WLO and higher smartphone shipments.

Our IFRS operating expenses were $44.2 million in the third quarter, up 17.4% from the preceding quarter and up 11.4% from a year ago. The sequential expense increase was caused mainly by $4.8 million of RSU, the immediately vested portion of the total RSU grant, which was higher than the $3 million guided on the last earnings call to beneficially compensate employees from a better-off profit.

The $1.8 million additional RSU expense represents $0.009 lower in after-tax EPS. The increased salary also contributed to the higher operating expenses. The year-over-year increase was a result of increased RSU. As an annual practice, we reward employees with an annual bonus at the end of September, which always leads to a substantial increase in third quarter IFRS operating expenses compared to the other quarters of the year. This year, the RSU grant totaled $5 million, out of which $4.8 million was vested immediately and expensed in the third quarter. Non-IFRS operating expenses for the third quarter were $38.9 million, up 4.8% from the previous quarter, but down 0.9% from the same quarter in 2019.

IFRS operating margin for the third quarter was 3.9%, up from 0.9% in prior quarter and up from minus 4.7% in the same period last year. The sequential increase was mainly due to higher sales and better gross margin, but offset by higher operating expenses. The year-over-year improvement was primarily a result of higher sales and improved gross margin.

Third quarter non-IFRS operating profit was $14.7 million or 6.1% of sales, higher from non-IFRS operating profit of $2.1 million or 1.1% of sales last quarter and up from minus 4.4% for the same period last year. IFRS profit for the third quarter was $8.5 million or $0.049 per diluted ADS compared to profit of $1.4 million or $0.008 per diluted ADS in the previous quarter and loss of $7.2 million or $0.042 per diluted ADS a year ago. Third quarter non-IFRS profit was $12.6 million or $0.073 per diluted ADS compared to non-IFRS profit of $1.7 million or $0.01 per diluted ADS last quarter and non-IFRS loss of $6.9 million or $0.04 per diluted ADS for the same period last year.

Turning to the balance Sheet. We had $142.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and other financial assets as of the end of September 2020 compared to $128 million at the same time last year and $107.1 million a quarter ago. The higher cash balance was mainly a result of an operating cash inflow of $33.5 million during the quarter. Restricted cash was $104 million at the end of the quarter compared to $164 million of the preceding quarter and a year ago.

The restricted cash is used to guarantee the short-term secured borrowings for the same amount. We repaid a total of $60 million short-term secured borrowings during the quarter, and in the meantime, the restricted cash deposit was reduced by the same amount. Separately, during this quarter, we entered into a new 10-year unsecured loan agreement of $60 million and repaid all short-term unsecured borrowings totaling $58.4 million. As a result, we had $60 million of long-term unsecured loans as of the end of Q3, of which $6 million was current portion.

There was no more short-term unsecured loan as of the end of the quarter compared to $58.4 million a quarter ago and $90.6 million at the same time last year. Not only have we strengthened our balance sheet by replacing all short-term unsecured borrowings with 10-year loans, we also managed to secure favorable terms of new long-term loan so that the additional interest payments are minimal.

Accounts receivable as of the end of September 2020 were $221.1 million, up from $206.1 million last quarter and $157.3 million a year ago. DSO was 99 days at the end of the quarter as compared to 86 days a year ago and 101 days at the end of the last quarter. Inventories as of September 30, 2020 were $125.7 million, down from $161.5 million last quarter and $167.6 million a year ago. The much lower inventory level in Q3 was a result of strong customer demands amid tight foundry capacity. While we will continue to pursue an aggressive inventory buildup strategy, our inventory position will likely remain at such a low level in the foreseeable future given the severe foundry capacity shortage prevailing in the marketplace.

Net cash inflow from operating activities for the third quarter was $33.5 million as compared to an inflow of $24 million for the same period last year and an outflow of $9.2 million last quarter. Third quarter capital expenditures amounted to $1.2 million versus $31.2 million a year ago and $0.7 million last quarter. The third quarter capex was for R&D-related equipment for our IC design businesses. As of September 30, 2020, Himax had 172.4 million ADS outstanding, little changed from last quarter. On a fully diluted basis, the total amount of ADS outstanding was 173.4 million.

Now, turning to our fourth quarter guidance. For the quarter, we expect further revenue growth from the already high level of Q3 in most of our business sectors. Gross margins will see a major uptick and could reach a quarterly historical high for us. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to increase by around 10% sequentially. Gross margin is expected to be around 29%, which will depend on final product mix.

With the increase in revenue and the margin growth in fourth quarter, net income should increase sequentially. To further reward employees, there would be another $3 million of cash bonus in the first quarter, which will be expensed immediately. This represents $0.014 lower EPS. IFRS profit attributable to shareholders is expected to be in the range of around $0.15 to $0.16 per fully diluted ADS. Non-IFRS profit attributable to shareholders is expected to be in the range of $0.151 to $0.161 per fully diluted ADS.

I will now turn the call over to Jordan. Jordan, the floor is yours?

Jordan Wu -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Thank you, Eric. Before we walk through each of our major product segments, I would like to briefly comment on the background for our upbeat Q4 gross margin guidance and our view on the sustainability of the higher margin. First off, gross margin expansion has always been at the top of our agenda and we will surely work hard toward continuous profitability improvement. The upbeat Q4 gross margin guidance is mainly a reflection of the tight foundry capacity, which results in better pricing and more favorable product mix.

The foundry industry appears to be going through a structural change in the supply demand dynamics for the mature process nodes, both 8-inch and 12-inch. We believes the current tightness is likely to persist throughout the next few years. Major volume applications such as display driver ICs for TDDI and AMOLED, PMIC for 5G smartphone, CIS that is ever upgrading in resolution, just to name a few, are significantly expanding in wafer consumption and competing for the same pool of mature nodes, while the industry has no major expansion plan in sight for such capacity.

As Eric mentioned, we are experiencing major foundry supply shortages in quite a few of our major business areas, including TDDI and DDIC for smartphone, tablet and automotive applications as well as CMOS image sensor. For next year's wafer demands, we have has secured with our foundry partners a capacity which is already larger than our total shipment for this year. On top of that, we are developing additional capacities for various product areas with an aim to further our available foundry pool for the next few years. Some of these new capacities will start making contributions next year. We will report the progress in due course.

Another important factor for continuous gross margin improvement will come from a number of our non-driver products, which are either already in volume production and look on track to grow in size, such as timing controller and ultra-low power CIS or will be new additions to our revenue stream, such as the WiseEye total solution and the WE-I ASIC chip. Again, gross margin expansion will continue to be one of our major business goals for next year and beyond.

Now let us start with an update on the large panel driver IC business. For the fourth quarter, we expect large display driver IC revenue to increase by high-single-digit sequentially. This is due to the extension of strong demand derived from persisting home working and distance education, resulting in growing monitor and notebook demands. We expect a decent sequential increase of around 20% in the monitor segment in the fourth quarter. As for notebook, we anticipate even stronger momentum in Q4, increasing more than 75% quarter-over-quarter.

We have active design activities in high end monitor and new generation low-power notebook where we provide not only our driver IC, but also timing controller. Especially in gaming monitors and e-learning notebooks, we anticipate more market share gains from the design wins of our leading display driver ICs and Tcon with key components -- key customers.

With respect to TV, we expect mid-single-digit sequential decline in the fourth quarter owing to a correction to a surge in TV demand in the previous quarter. Recently, we saw top-tier TV brands with aggressive promotion tactics in 8K TVs in anticipation of major sporting events resuming across many countries after a long lockdown. Our 8K TV display drivers and timing controller ICs have been widely adopted by multiple leading end customers. It is worth highlighting that we have been developing and delivering timing controller products for many years, and this segment already represents more than 5% of our total revenues. It is applied in a wide range of products such as TV, monitor, notebook and automotive.

Our technology not only provides higher resolution, higher frame rate and better image quality, it can also enable lower power in products where power consumption is critical. The margin and ASP of the timing controller products are much higher than those of display drivers, and we expect this segment to be an extensive long-term growth opportunity. Our Tcon revenue in the fourth quarter, while limited by a capacity shortage in IC packaging due to competing demands from 5G chipsets, is on track to increase by more than 20% sequentially. This will represent more than 40% increase annually.

Now, let's turn to the small and medium-sized display driver IC business, beginning with an update on the smartphone segment. Our TDDI product roadmap as well as new design wins and new production plans all position Himax well to gain market share throughout 2020 and into 2021. As I mentioned on the last earnings call, the pandemic has weighed on the global smartphone shipment significantly due to supply chain disruption at the beginning of the year, followed by a lackluster consumer demand. However, the smartphone market has regained some momentum in Q3, and the momentum seems to have carried into Q4. On the backdrop of a rebounding smartphone market, our smartphone TDDI revenue is projected to have nice high-teens sequential growth in the fourth quarter, although foundry capacity remains a major growth constraint. Traditional display driver ICs for smartphone, after a temporary spike in Q3, is set to decline double-digit in Q4.

As stated before, AMOLED technology has advanced to become the mainstream display for high end smartphones. Himax is highly committed in this field. Much progress has been made by collaborating with leading panel makers across China. Our development started from smartphone and extends to wearable, tablet and automotive with Chinese panel makers. We believe AMOLED display driver IC will become one of the major growth engines for our small and medium panel driver IC business from 2021.

Tablet has been one of our top sales contributors throughout 2020. In the fourth quarter, it is on track for another sequential growth of over 20%. As mentioned on previous earnings calls, for consumers, tablet TDDI offers a lighter weight and slimmer and more stylish design as well as improved touch accuracy with added option for active stylus, specifically geared toward high quality writing and drawing.

Himax is a pioneer in the tablet TDDI technology and led the market for mass production in the first quarter of 2020. At present, we are the dominant supplier for literally all leading Android names. Tablet TDDI represents a tremendous upside potential for Himax, thanks to its higher ASP and more units of TDDI chips in each tablet than those for smartphone. We expect a sequential increase of around 80% for our tablet TDDI in the fourth quarter as the penetration of in-cell touch into tablet continues to accelerate. To expand and strengthen our position in the market for next generation models, we are working on new designs with resolution and touch accuracy upgrades, targeting larger size tablets from key customers.

For traditional DDIC for tablet, we expect low-teens sequential decline for Q4, but sales to be up more than 50% compared to the same period last year due to the booming tablet demand arising from home working and remote learning. The demand for traditional DDIC for tablet is also being eroded by in-cell TDDI, but at a more moderate pace than that for smartphone.

Turning to the automotive sector. As the panels inside a car continue to grow in both number and size, the demand for automotive driver ICs is well positioned for healthy growth in the coming years. Although the global car demand has been badly hit by COVID-19, especially in the first half of the year, the market is showing signs of gradual recovery, starting Q3. Our automotive ICs, which enjoy higher gross margins, are experiencing a solid rebound lately with car makers rushing in for inventory replenishment after quite a few sluggish quarters.

The demand for automotive display ICs for more sophisticated and higher performing displays has continued its rising trajectory. Advanced new features such as in-cell touch, local dimming, cascade-topology connection and point-to-point high-speed interface bridging functions are being adopted with Himax being the primary partner for major automotive panel makers and Tier 1 players to enable these new technologies. With these new technologies on track for more shipments starting 2021, we are confident that our automotive segment is hitting another inflection point with a strong and positive long-term outlook.

For the fourth quarter, revenues for small and medium-sized driver IC business is expected to increase by around mid-teens sequentially with demand continuing to surpass supply. Capacity shortage remains a major factor that negatively impacts our capabilities to make more shipments to customers. In consideration of capacity constraints, which may not be resolved shortly, we often have to strategically prioritize the production of products for those customer models where we are the key supplier and/or enjoy better profitability.

Now, let me share some of the progress we've made on the non-driver IC businesses in the third quarter. First, on the WLO business. The fourth quarter WLO revenue declined sequentially as a result of lower shipments to an anchor customer. Our WLO factory will continue to manufacture the anchor customer's legacy products going forward. With our exceptional technologies of WLO in nano-imprinting manufacturing and diffraction optics design, we have been engaged by multiple customers/partners to develop further generation -- to develop future generation products covering a wide range of applications such as ToF 3D sensing, waveguide for AR goggles, biomedical devices and others.

Next is an update on the 3D sensing business. Targeting next generation Android smartphones, we are collaborating with leading laser and ToF sensor vendors to develop a new world-facing 3D sensing camera, whereby we provide optical components and/or projectors which are critical for the performance of the whole ToF solution. For non-smartphone 3D-sensing engagements where we provide a structured light-based 3D sensing total solution, our target markets range from smart door lock, facial recognition-based e-payment, business access control to biomedical inspection device. A number of recent design wins will enter into mass production soon.

Alternatively, we also offer a market-leading 3D decoder ASIC to those customers who wish to design their own structured light 3D sensing solution. Here we have had quite a few design wins from customers targeting China's vast e-payment market with some shipments already starting in the fourth quarter. We are also working with customers for industrial robotics, smart door lock and home security, all of which carry great potential for our 3D business in the future.

Now switching gears to WiseEye smart sensing solution. As I mentioned on the last couple of earnings call, in order for our WiseEye technology to reach its maximum potential, we have adopted a flexible business model, whereby in addition to a total solution where we provide processor, image sensor and AI algorithm. We also offer those key parts individually in order to address the customer's different needs and widen our market reach.

For the total solution offering, our current focus applications include notebook, TV, doorbell, door lock and air conditioner as we continue to work out new solutions to cover further edge device AI markets. In partnership with leading players in their respective industries, a number of these solutions are slated to enter mass production in 2021. For the other type of business model where we only offers key parts, our strategy is to actively participate in the ecosystems led by the world's leading AI and cloud service providers.

In addition to the collaboration with Google on their TensorFlow Lite for micro-controllers that we announced previously, we are making another major breakthrough by partnering with another world-leading cloud service provider with a business focus more toward healthcare, financial services, government, retail and industrial manufacturing.

Separately, to further lower the technical barrier for using our WiseEye solution, we teamed up with a leading online store specialized in easy development tools for machine learning on edge devices. We are extremely excited about the rapid business progress and believe our WiseEye offerings will become a major contributor to our P&L in the near future.

Now turning to our CMOS image sensor business update. We continue to see extremely strong demands for our CMOS image sensors for IP camera and notebook, but our actual shipment has been badly capped by the foundry capacity available to us. Separately, our industry-first two-in-one CMOS image sensor that supports RGB mode for video conferencing and ultra-low power AI mode for facial recognition has penetrated the laptop ecosystem for their most stylish super-slim bezel designs. We expect to have small volume shipment toward late 2020 with more to come in the next year.

Regarding ultra-low power always-on CMOS image sensor, which targets in battery powered or always-on applications. We are getting promising feedback and design adoptions from customers in various markets, such as car recorders, surveillance, smart electronic meters, drones, home appliances and consumer electronics. In Q4, the CIS revenue is expected to be flat sequentially, although demand is much stronger than that. Again, our shipment is capped by foundry capacity constraint. For non-driver IC business, we expect revenue to decrease by low-single-digit sequentially in the fourth quarter.

That concludes my report for this quarter. Thank you for your interest in Himax. We appreciate you joining today's call. We are now ready to take questions.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Tristan Gerra from Baird. You may begin.

Tristan Gerra -- Baird Equity Research -- Analyst

Hi, guys, and congratulations on the results. Given the capacity that you secured for next year as well as your own capacity plans, what type of revenue do you think this is going to support for 2021?

Jordan Wu -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

I said earlier in my prepared remarks, we have secured with our various foundry partners, that is one way of arrangements, many of which are legally binding a capacity, a total capacity covering all type of our products. That has already been higher than our actual shipments made during this year. So that is our starting point and something that is not enough for us. That is not going to satisfy our expected demand for next year.

So in the meantime, we are developing quite aggressively, again, with different foundry partners, covering different product areas to expand our capacity. But I have to say that such development is something we're not starting to take, it started actually quite some time ago. But this is not something that you can turnaround overnight. So I think additional capacity on top of the capacities we have already secured with our foundry partners.

You will see -- I mean, for example, in Q1, the addition will be rather limited. And there will be some contribution from Q2 and more Q3 and furthermore in Q4 and even more, probably much more going forward. So it's a aggressive effort. However, it has to be a gradual process. And again, the capacity is so tight nowadays, I mean, you guys all know. So we just have to accept the reality and manage our customers, manage our products, prioritize our production, and in the meantime, continue to develop new foundries and new capacities. And we -- it's fair to say, we are making good progress.

And right now, what we are seeing is -- for our sales the most severe are basically three areas. The first area being smartphone and tablet TDDI, which share the same pool and our strategy, given our very high market share in the Android TDDI tablet market right now. So we tend to give more favorable allocation to heavily over smartphone, to be honest because we carry a very heavy responsibility dealing with end customers, in particular when in many, many cases we actually the sole source. So if we stop, it will reduce. If we can't ship enough, then it's a big problem for them, while customers for our smartphone TDDI tend to have better preparation from multiple sources.

And so that is the first area of foundry tightness. And again, we are working rather aggressively with at least to make foundry partners developing new capacities. And again, we are hoping to see real contribution some time next year. But -- I mean, before it actually happens, I really can't comment much further than that, but we will certainly report in due course.

The second major area of shortage is automotive display driver. It's an area where we enjoyed a very good market share, probably number one in the world, around 37% of market -- global market share right now. And the shortage starting from early Q3 has been very, very severe. And looking into next year, it's looking to probably get worse even. And again, we have secured with a very solid arrangement with our foundry partners to meaningfully enlarge our capacity available to us next year compared to the shipments or excess shipments this year. And on top of that, we are -- hopefully we can announce fairly quickly, fairly soon, we are arranging additional major increase of capacities for automotive longer term. And it's something that is so designated. We've got the pressure, inquiries from not just panel maker customers, but also Tier 1s in many of them. And many of them wish to enter into some kind of arrangement to secure their supply, even though we are the major provider of the market right now.

And the third area, which is relatively small in our business contribution, but the shortage is probably the most severe, which is CMOS image sensor. This year, as we all know, because of the COVID situation, there is a huge -- there is a sudden surge in demand for our PC camera because people tend to use their notebooks for teleconference, and notebook which has relatively poor camera resolution, people like to get the PC camera connected. So there is a sudden surge in demand and we simply cannot meet the demand. And we have certain customers who are major, major players in the PC camera market.

So it is relatively small for us overall, but the shortage is quite severe. So we are prepared in all aspects to try to grow our capacity. But again, no miracle is going to happen. And certainly, in Q1, we don't expect any meaningful increase in capacity.

Tristan Gerra -- Baird Equity Research -- Analyst

Okay. That's very useful. And then just as a quick follow-up. What are the implications for ASPs for the rest of -- for this quarter and for next year?

Jordan Wu -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

On an apple-to-apple basis to reflect the foundry capacity tightness, certainly, we are able to raise our ASP in a degree that it certainly varies in accordance with the different degrees of tightness in capacity. So the sectors that I just named, tend to -- will tend to enjoy better ASP increase compared to those sectors that I didn't mention just now, primarily large panel display drivers. Although they are still tight, but they are not in severe shortage, let me put it that way. So I think we have very good visibility in Q1, unusually good visibility in Q1 with customers all lined up with the appeal and whatnot.

And I can say with fairly good confidence across -- toward the whole first half, I think the visibility is quite good. Longer term, it certainly hasn't propelled. It's going to depend largely on the development of COVID situation. We all know that nobody has the answer. I think the quarter is something beyond our control. What we can control ourselves is aggressive design-in and design win engagement at this moment, while taking advantage that we are one of the largest players in the marketplace and adding the capacity is very tight.

So I think we have made tremendous progress across different product segments for new design-ins and design wins. And our engagement has reached out much more compared to the past, not just panel makers, but also to system makers and product indirect customers. So I think that longer term is going to be a major plus for us. Historically, our engagement with such end customers typically are more toward technology discussions -- technology engagements. Now a lot of it is also about this -- I think that is a very important benefit because of the tightness.

I guess one last thing -- and I appreciate your question. I think I will elaborate a little bit. One last thing is that I do believe we do have a very good solid visibility longer term in automotive sector, mainly for three reasons, really. One, our major target customers are growing their market share in the big way. So we get to enjoy, because our market share with them individually is very, very high, much higher than our average in the world. So when they are growing their market share, we get the benefit. So we do support them aggressively in this effort.

And secondly is the pick-up of TDDI penetration in other market. We are the pioneer in the world in introducing TDDI to auto panels. Our first mass production actually took place maybe toward the end of last year, 2018. But more meaningful contributor -- revenue contribution started from this year, but this year it's still small. We all know how automotive market works. It takes -- the design cycle takes a long time.

So next year, you are going to see many, many times the size of this year, many times. It could be as much as close to 10 times. And TDDI for automotive probably is starting from next year. We can see some meaningful contribution to our top-line and bottom line. And we expect further penetration, non-stop. It's a one-way street going forward for TDDI penetration into auto. And that is major, major good news for us, because one, our design-in coverage, our design win coverage is very, very good at the moment.

And secondly, TDDI for auto enjoys much better ASP and gross margin compared to the display driver for auto and certainly also compared with TDDI for tablet or smartphone. So that is the second reason TDDI penetration. And the third reason, I mentioned earlier already, we are entering into major and aggressive long-term capacity expansion plan together with our partners, covering both traditional display driver IC for auto and also TDDI. So for these three major factors, I think we are really at an inflection point for auto business.

We have enjoyed -- we enjoy many years of growth. I can't recall how many, but many years of sequential growth for auto business before hitting a brake in kind of in 2018 -- second half 2018 to first half 2019. And I think we'll lead the market in seeing a recovery starting from Q3. And in Q4 this year, I just mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's looking very solid, the growth rate. And so, again, I think this is where [Indecipherable] to embark on a major long-term growth for auto sector. And the good news is auto has always been for many, many years the highest gross margin product segment for us. So this is very exciting new for us. Sorry for the very long answer. I thought I'd take this opportunity to elaborate a little bit.

Tristan Gerra -- Baird Equity Research -- Analyst

That's very useful. Thank you very much.

Jordan Wu -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Thank you, Tristan.

Operator

And our next question will come from the line of Donnie Teng from Nomura. You may begin.

Donnie Teng -- Nomura Securities -- Analyst

Thank you, Jordan, Eric and management team for taking my question, and congratulations on the very strong guidance. My first question is regarding to the guidance. So could you elaborate a little bit more or quantify how do you come up with like 10% sales growth in fourth quarter by breaking down into maybe roughly shipment and ASP growth if possible? Thank you.

Jordan Wu -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

I'm afraid I can't really give too much specifics on revenue and ASP growth. But again, I can give you a broad idea. ASP growth come primarily from TDDI, both for smartphone and tablet as well as automotive. Those shortage sectors. And for large panel, I think ASP has sustained in a solid level, but I can't say they enjoy major growth like for those other sectors. And so for large panel, the market is -- the foundry situation is tight, but it's not in shortage as such. So I think that is kind of the background. But why -- I mean we guided for about 10% sales growth for Q4, I think that is -- we are -- I think that is quite solid.

And I think firstly TV is probably the only major sector that is set to decline a little bit, probably mid-single-digit because TV makers after quite a couple of good seasons, they are entering into some kind of inventory correction period. But other than that, I mentioned, for monitor, first three quarters combined very strong compared to last year, but the third quarter, there was a major dip. But we don't see that as a weakness in demand, rather for monitor, it is really customers' inventory adjustment. So Q4, we are seeing a major rebound. And notebook also is kind of close to 100% kind of increase sequentially.

And certainly, the biggest growth will come from tablet in kind of revenue contribution. Tablet TDDI continue to grow in penetration and we dominated the market. So Q4, TDDI for tablet will be up something like 80% and with good ASP contribution because a good percentage of TDDI goes into what we call IC tables, the active stylus, and that always will enjoy better ASP and better margin.

Smartphone will be up high-single-digit. Again, demand is much higher than our supply, the major capacity constraint. But the good news is, we are -- we continue to gain market share in smartphone, although under such difficult situations in terms of foundry. In automotive, I mentioned, we'll be up more than 20% sequentially. We are very, very happy with more of a rebound in the midst of a pretty bearish market for automotive worldwide.

And so that kind of gives you a flavor of the major revenue contributions, meaning monitor, notebook, smartphone, tablet and auto, with the major -- with the only major declining sector being TV, which is only down -- could be down like mid-single-digit only. So it's across the board pretty even, the growth.

Donnie Teng -- Nomura Securities -- Analyst

Thank you, Jordan. And can I have a follow-up? Under this kind of situation, are you considering to raise price further in the first quarter, including in large display driver ICs or raise again on TDDI, as you just mentioned?

Jordan Wu -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

I think we have to respond to the markets and our competitors' move. But I think in all likelihood, the answer is yes. But we will just have to wait. We'll have to continue to observe the market and manage the customer, and we'll see. But I mean, certainly, the likelihood of our lowering -- our ASP I think is very, very low.

Donnie Teng -- Nomura Securities -- Analyst

I see. And my second question is regarding to the gross margin. Do you think this kind of 29% level will be a new norm? Or may I ask if your foundry partners have all raised the wafer price in fourth quarter yet or some of them will not raise the price until first quarter next year? Thank you.

Jordan Wu -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

They certainly have raised their prices for Q4 to a very large degree. And certainly -- and also our second suppliers have worked, especially for testers and for timing control, the packaging as well. And your question whether this 29%-ish kind of growth module will be a new norm, we certainly hope so. And certainly, we have all the intentions to keep it this way and to actually grow from here further next year and beyond for the reasons I mentioned. I think, one, our foundry tightness for material technology appears to be a long-term thing. And two, our capabilities to grow potential capacity actually is going to enhance our -- it is going to help defending our margin as well because customers were -- will be happy to come to Himax more than less because we do have upside volume to grow. And thirdly, we have very good solid design wins across the board. I just mentioned, covering not just direct customers, but also indirect customers, that is very helpful. I'm talking about from TV all the way to automotive. So I think this is very exciting development.

And lastly, longer term, I just want to emphasize again the importance of our new product areas such as WiseEye. I think that will be very exciting. It's long-term, it's something it will have less top-line contribution than bottom line because margin will be much, much higher for such products. And it's something -- timing controller, we have seen it is all within expectation. We have seen very healthy growth this year. And I think the growth is in all likelihood is going to continue into next year and beyond. So yes, the short answer is, yes. We intend to defend such a level of margin and try to even improve it further for next year.

Donnie Teng -- Nomura Securities -- Analyst

Thank you, Jordan. And kind of a follow-up is that, when you say that all the -- most of your foundry partners have raised the price, is that in like wafer in base overall base cost. I'm just curious that I'm not sure whether it's some foundry partners wafering. So the actual price -- wafer price hike should be more...

Jordan Wu -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Sorry, sorry. We were out. We were output. Accounting wise, when we say they've raised the price, for us it is -- the increase in our cost of goods sold. I mean in inventory already it's we were out, and that is related to the shipments we make. So we are talking about the Q4 COGS. That's what we are referring to when we talk about foundry raising their prices.

Donnie Teng -- Nomura Securities -- Analyst

So they...

Jordan Wu -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

They're raising prices much earlier on because the foundry production there is probably about a quarter of lead time.

Donnie Teng -- Nomura Securities -- Analyst

Yes. Is there any write-off, inventory write-off in fourth quarter as well as third quarter?

Jordan Wu -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Certainly. There are always inventory write-offs each quarter. But I think largely, thanks to our efforts over the last year or two to much tighten our inventory management. I think we are able to lower our overall inventory writedown each quarter. And on top of that, it is just a lucky coincidence that the market is so tight that inventory now it is actually not only it is a problem in the sense that we feel our inventory level right now is too low rather than too high and the writedown requirement is much less than otherwise. So two factors. Our much improved inventory write -- inventory management internal procedure. And secondly, the tightness of the market.

And I mentioned probably twice in my prepared remarks that in certain circumstances, there are certain goods that we have, according to volumes and inventory management protocol which has been going on for many years. We have written down certain products, while the goods we still kept. We are not going to sell them, although accounting-wise there may be much decrease in cost or the cost base can in some cases decrease to zero. But because of tightness of the market, we are able to sell those products. So that certainly is a very high margin. But volume -- but the revenue contribution wise it's really quite small, but there are such incidents. So it's just a reflection of how tight the market is right now.

Donnie Teng -- Nomura Securities -- Analyst

Yes. Thank you so much, Jordan. Congratulations again.

Jordan Wu -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Thank you, Donnie.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of -- from Jerry Su from Credit Suisse. You may begin.

Jerry Su -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

Hi. Thank you for taking my question. First question regarding on the TDDI. Can you talk a little bit about what's beyond tablet, automotive, etc.? I think we have heard some of the industry, all your peers, a lot of car makers are interested to adopt TDDI on notebook and also other applications. Which area you are seeing more opportunities and what's the entry period there?

Jordan Wu -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

I think given the current tightness of capacity for smartphone and the tablet already, I really don't feel there is much room for notebook in the foreseeable future. First off, because we do have the technology. And if TDDI for notebook is to happen, it's going to have rather similar ICs compared to those for tablet, as you only mentioned.

I think for us, TDDI, I mentioned already, so I'll just repeat it very briefly. I think automotive is the major growth area. Automotive had different reason. It's not asking for -- isn't asking for the thin border or light display, it's not. It is really for three reasons. One, when the ambient light or sunlight is very, very bright, you feel better -- the consumer can feel better with in-cell display because you don't feel kind of additional layer of course on top of your panel. And right now it appears to be even more convincing reason for in-cell and TDDI is that [Indecipherable] displays are getting much larger in size and much higher in resolution and people are talking about shrinks, such as what they call pillar-to-pillar displays. We are talking about in some cases, about 50-inch, 60-inch, even 70-inch panel displays for automotive.

So we want to make a display so big you do need to double in-cell technology because within in-cell, you don't have to have the trouble of bounding a third layer of glass, which is split on top of the already completed display. And if you -- the third layer of glass, the bounding, if it goes wrong, it is going to damage the already finished display, which is very expensive, as we mentioned. And when you have display so large, it's very difficult to bound, especially for automotive when you make -- you were making such a large display, you need to enable what I call [Indecipherable] meaning the display is not a straight piece of glass. So that makes the bounding process even harder. So it is now proven to be a necessity.

Now when the display size go to a certain level, you do have to have TDDI. And now larger display for automotive is looking to be a major trend. So I think, again, we are the leader in that space, and we are very excited about this development. So I think TDDI for automotive application is going to be important for the industry and certainly for Himax.

Jerry Su -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

Okay. Thank you. And then the second question is about the AMOLED driver IC, and you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you're expecting to see some more revenue contribution from 2021. Can you elaborate a little bit more about which area will see a faster growth? I mean -- or for Himax to faster penetrate into? Is it wearable or [Indecipherable] and now so beside -- beyond the Chinese panel makers any opportunities to get into the Korean panel makers in AMOLED? Thank you.

Jordan Wu -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Thank you, Jerry. I don't want to comment too much -- especially I can't cover too much specifics before it happens. So again, I want to repeat, we are very committed to this. So we are not going to be absent from this very important long-term market. You have mentioned quite a few applications, meaning wearable, auto, smartphone and tablet. We are in all of them. And we have good high quality solid major engagements with direct panel makers and indirect end user customers, in literally all of them.

Which one will enter mass production earlier than others, I think it's probably a bit premature to tell. So if you would allow us to elaborate further when it happens. But I can say, certainly we are targeting mass production starting next year. And the major contribution certainly, hopefully, will come from smartphone. That is quite obvious, followed by tablet and then wearable, auto will be the lowest. But I think I can't -- I don't want to start uncovering them before it actually happens. But I think we are very, very close to some major breakthrough. So we'll see.

Jerry Su -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

Okay. And then about the panel customers. Are you seeing opportunities to penetrate into the Korean auto customers?

Jordan Wu -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

I can't comment on that. It's too customer specific, because they are really just one for large panel and for small panel when it comes to Korea panel makers device. I think that will be 12 years, if I make any comments one or the other. Sorry about that.

Jerry Su -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

Okay, that's fine. Okay. Thank you.

Jordan Wu -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

This video was recorded on Nov. 9, 2020.

Jason Moser: It's Monday, November 9th. I'm your host Jason Moser. On this week's Financial show, we're going to dig into the news of some very encouraging vaccine results and how that could potentially impact our world of financials related stocks. We've got a few earnings reports to dig into, we've also got our ones to watch for the coming week. Joining me this week, as most weeks, glad to have him as always, Certified Financial Planner, Mr. Matt Frankel. Matt, how's everything going?

Matt Frankel: Well, pretty much every stock that I've ever mentioned on the show is up by more than 10% today, so I'm having a pretty good morning, I don't know about you.

Moser: [laughs] Yeah. Hey, listen, you know, I don't let the stock market dictate my attitude, but it's certainly nice when you see them go up, I mean, you don't see --

Frankel: I don't either, but today might be an exception. [laughs]

Moser: We're seeing certainly some of them are going down, and we'll get into that, the whole stay-at-home stock phenomenon and how that's playing out. That will be just one part of our broader discussion here, but you know, let's go ahead and jump into this discussion, because clearly the big news of the day, the drugmakers Pfizer and BioNTech have indicated that their COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective.

Now, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves here. This could mean a lot of different things, but it really does seem, at the very core, it marks a major step in the right direction in this battle against COVID-19. And clearly, Wall Street is loving the news. Stocks across the board are feeling pretty good today, with the exception of the stay-at-home stocks; of course, we'll get to those.

But, Matt, one area of the market where we're seeing a big reaction, and it's something we talk a lot about here on the show, it's in Real Estate Investment Trusts, those REITs that we talk about a lot. Talk to us a little bit about why you think that the REIT segment of the market is receiving this news so positively?

Frankel: You got to remember there are many different subsectors of REITs that have kind of different, you know, dynamics here. So, there are some stay-at-home REITs, like, think of the data center REITs and things like that, and they're, kind of, not doing that great today. But most REITs own commercial properties that depend on people being able and willing to go places. So, when you look at just some of these numbers, and these were at 12:30, so they might have changed [laughs] by the time you are hearing this. Just some of the favorite ones we talk about on here, Empire State, the company that owns the Empire State Building, is up 30% today. Tanger Outlets that we talk about, they're up 23% today. Simon Property Group, the biggest mall REIT is up 26%. EPR Properties, about half of its portfolio is movie theaters, is up 41% today alone.

Moser: Yeah, that was the one I wanted to talk with you a little bit more about, I'll let you finish, but EPR that was one that struck me as standing out.

Frankel: Yeah. Welltower, which is healthcare REIT that owns a lot of senior housing -- which for obvious reasons, that hasn't been doing well -- is up 17% today. And last one, a lot of people are worried that people are going to leave cities if this pandemic keeps going, and AvalonBay, the big apartment REIT that owns a lot of urban apartment buildings, is up 12% today. So, across the board with all the, kind of, reopening REITs are doing phenomenally well today.

Moser: Yeah. And you're talking about people leaving the cities, you're talking about, sort of, that bigger picture idea that with going more toward a remote workforce or at least companies adopting the mindset that their employees can work offsite, perhaps permanently in many cases, I mean, that's going to maybe reduce the demand for living in these big cities. You talk about moving out toward the suburbs, and it sounds like apartment complex REITs, like the one you mentioned, that's got to be the reason for the optimism, I assume.

Frankel: Well, for sure. And also, take it with a grain of salt, because these are some of the most beaten down stocks during the pandemic. When I mentioned EPR, they're still roughly less than half of what they were trading for before the pandemic, even after today. So, a lot of these are really beaten down. And AvalonBay, the apartment one, I'm not saying there's going to be no remote work trend that prompts people to leave cities, but the stock is down 40% year-to-date, and the vacancy rate increased by 3%. So, that kind of just seems like it's not balanced correctly.

Moser: Yeah, it doesn't, you're right. And it's always worth remembering too, when we see headlines like this, because this is a headline we woke up to this morning, all across the country you could tell, I mean, there was plenty of excitement out there, because this is the news that you want to hear, right? This is not the magic bullet, so to speak, but this is definitely the news that you want to hear. It always strikes me too -- and I'm not trying to take the glass half empty perspective here, but when you see this type of reaction, it's always worth remembering, this isn't over, right? I mean, this marks a big step forward, but we're not through this yet. So, we still have a full Winter here, really, to go through.

And it feels like, let's try to temper everybody's expectations, you know, get questions throughout the morning on should I be buying these stocks or selling these stocks. And it's like, you know what, oftentimes, for investors, it's better to maybe take news like this, digest it through the course of the day, give yourself some time to think about things, the implications here, because it really, kind of, feels like this is great news. But there's most certainly going to be another bad headline at some point here in the next week, two weeks, one month, whatever it may be. So, it's always worth remembering, listen, this doesn't just mean everything is back to normal and everything is hunky-dory. I mean, this is good news, but we're not through this yet.

Frankel: Yeah, I mean, don't throw off your mask and run out into the streets to play just yet. But having said that, this was definitely good news, but this is going to take some time to really roll out. At a minimum, Pfizer said they will be ready to submit for emergency approval by the end of this month if everything goes well, that's two weeks after they have all their participants have gone through the trial for two months rather. After that, they're only going to make 50 million doses or so this year. So, even assuming they get all 50 million of those into people's arms by the end of this year, that's still roughly 80% of the U.S. population that is not going to be vaccinated. And then you have another few months, figure sometime in mid-2021, anyone who really needs a COVID vaccine will have one, so. And that's if things go well from here on. But this is definitely a step in the right direction, and these companies desperately needed some light at the end of the tunnel.

And another thing to mention is that a lot of this could be short covering that we're seeing today. You're seeing this spike. I mean, I looked right before we were on and some of the names I mentioned don't have a ton of short interest, but if you look at some of these numbers, they are just, kind of, off the charts. Tanger Outlets, for example, 51% of its shares are sold short right now. Seritage Growth Properties, 50% of its shares are sold short. EPR, it's over 10%. Almost 9% of Empire State Realty is sold short. So, you could see some of these, you know, people might be covering their shorts on this news too, which could be really fueling today's price action.

Moser: Yeah, and that's certainly not to take away from the gains that the stocks are seeing, but it's worth remembering, yeah, you said it, they've fallen a long way, short covering is what it is, but remember, that's not fundamentally really tied to the business. I mean, that's a short-term thing in nature anyway. And we're still really waiting for some form of stimulus package to come, hopefully sooner rather than later, because clearly, folks still need it, and it sounds like it's really just going to boil down to the President and the Senate negotiating some sort of a package there. I don't think it's really a matter of whether stimulus comes or not, it's really just a matter of how big the stimulus package really is.

So, let's pivot over and talk about that a little bit in regard to banks, because you see banks are another sector today that are really feeling the love. I'm looking at Bank of America here, for example. Right now, as we're recording the show, Bank of America shares are up 14%. I was looking at Ameris Bancorp (NASDAQ:ABCB) earlier, Ameris Bancorp up +20% today. So, you're seeing that covering everywhere from big banks to small banks and everywhere in between. This is interest rate related news, of course, but banks are going to benefit from positive economic news, I mean, they're going to benefit from a healthy economy, and if this is one step closer to a healthier economy then you can certainly understand the optimism in banks today as well.

Frankel: Right. Well, there's kind of two reasons you're seeing banks benefit from this. No. 1 is interest rates. This isn't interest rate specific news, but the 10-year Treasury soared to its highest level since March today. And so, that's kind of a forward-looking indicator that the economy is going to be healthier than people thought. You know, higher interest rates means higher profits for banks, but that's really not the main driving force. The main driving force is that there's a fear that there's going to be kind of a long-tailed uptick in loan losses, people can't afford to pay their bills, things like that, that's going to go on until this pandemic is over. And it's a well-founded fear, if you look at the numbers during the financial crisis when unemployment was elevated for a couple of years after the financial crisis, loan losses at some of these lenders stayed pretty high. So, there is that fear. And the sooner we can get back to business as usual, the sooner that fear goes away, and we're starting to see some of that today.

And if you look at some of the riskier consumer-facing lenders, you're seeing the gains are even higher, you mentioned Ameris, which is pretty much a consumer-facing bank. American Express is up 21% today, making our friend Warren Buffett a lot of money in the process.

Moser: [laughs] I mean, it's easy to forget, American Express is a bank. Yes, it's that credit card in your wallet, but it is technically a bank, and so it's beholden to all of those capital requirements and those rules and whatnot that your Bank of America and JPMorgans have to adhere to as well.

Frankel: They are the lender for -- if you use your AmEx Card, American Express is the company lending you money. So, if you run into trouble, you lose your job, something like that, and can't afford to pay it back, American Express is the one who gets left with an uncollectible debt. As the fears of that, kind of, start to go away, you're going to see those companies benefit. The more consumer-facing banks like Ameris, like, American Express. Wells Fargo, out of the big four, I think, was the biggest mover today, because it's a consumer-facing bank, not just an investment bank. And if you look at some of the investment banks, like Goldman Sachs, it's up by 7% today, which -- [laughs] the fact that it's up by 7% is, like, the worst gain in the sector, is pretty impressive. But that's because the investment banking businesses generally held up better during the pandemic, and you're seeing all these consumer-facing banks really pop because the experts are less fearful that you're going to see this long-tailed loan default wave come through.

Moser: And then you look even deeper into some of those numbers, and we've seen this over the past couple of quarters at least with a lot of these banks, the themes during a lot of these calls have really revolved around those loan loss reserves. These banks are reserving a lot of money, they're putting a lot of money aside for the potential for the possible losses that they could incur. If those losses don't materialize, or they don't materialize to the levels that those banks thought that they would. Well, that's a lot of money they put aside that is then going to be able to go, really, right back down the bottom-line for these banks at the end of the day.

Frankel: Yeah, they call that a reserve release, and you saw that a little bit in a few of the banks in the third quarter. You know, they were setting aside billions and billions of dollars in the first half of the year. And it turns out that the pandemic didn't turn out to a worst-case scenario economically, part of that was due to the CARES Act, part of that was due to just, I mean, it didn't continue to spiral out of control in March, it kind of leveled off after the shut downs and things like that. So, the economic impacts weren't a worst-case scenario.

2020 hasn't been a great economic year by any definition of the word, but we've definitely avoided a worst-case scenario. So, banks were able to release a little bit of their reserves, some banks, during the third quarter. If there is a widely available vaccine and the pandemic ends and, you know, unemployment already is under 7% in this country, if it falls back to pre-pandemic levels, which were in the 3% and 4% range, then you'll see a lot of these reserves come back and be released, and that turns into a big earnings boost for these banks. We saw that in the years following the financial crisis when they were finally allowed to release some reserves.

Moser: For sure. We're going to pivot into a little bit of a discussion here on the ""stay-at-home"" stocks, it's been a pretty unique phenomenon to 2020, I think, and an interesting one to discuss. And I guess to kick that discussion off, for me, really, it's interesting to see this disparity between four particular stocks. And if you look at MasterCard and Visa, for example. The market is rewarding those companies today, their stocks are doing very well. On the flip side of it, you look at Square and PayPal, those are companies where the stocks are actually selling off, and I think it's just interesting to note that, because we talk about this a lot, where MasterCard and Visa really -- I mean, at the end of the day, these aren't banks, they're not lenders, these are networks, these are toll booth models, they're really good proxies for the economy for consumer spending.

And if this is news that tells us that maybe the consumer is going to be able to come back a little bit more quickly, that things are going to start looking a little bit better, I can certainly understand why companies like MasterCard and Visa would be feeling some of the love today. But you flip it over, you look at PayPal and Square. PayPal and Square smaller companies, a little bit more diverse in what they do and what they offer. I wonder, perhaps some of the pullback on these stocks today is valuation related, they both had [laughs] really good years, but it seems like there would be something more to it. I mean, there's definitely the Square Capital side of the business. PayPal just chalked up a tremendous quarter, and again, it's had a tremendous year thus far. I wonder if those pull backs aren't just a little bit more valuation related than anything else.

Frankel: You got to think that Visa and MasterCard, they make the bulk of their money from a percentage of the transactions they process, they don't care whether those transactions are in-person or online, there might be a little difference in the pricing and the fees they make, but, you know, rise in consumer spending in any form is good for those companies. So, the fact that consumer spending is forecast to rise now, presumably because of a vaccine, is good for Visa and MasterCard just in general, it doesn't matter if people are doing e-commerce, if they're going out to the malls, things like that.

On PayPal especially, on the PayPal side of the equation, PayPal depends -- well, not just depends, but they benefit, specifically, from online spending. If you saw during the third quarter, PayPal added more subscribers, I think, than they ever have before, or their payment volume increased by more than it ever has before. And that's because people are -- for the most part -- I mean, we're venturing out a little bit to stores, but for the most part people are still staying home and shopping at home. And that's why Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) sales are still through the roof and things like that. So, PayPal benefits when people are spending money online.

Square, their core business is still in-person payment processing, but they are a fintech company, they're building out their online capabilities, the Cash App definitely does better in a stay-at-home environment for the time being at least, with what it has to offer. You know, person-to-person money transfers aren't happening in-person right now, so people are using things like the Cash App. And like you said, a lot of it could be valuation.

These have been some of the best-performing stocks, so I think today's news could have triggered a rotation from those high flying tech stocks into these value stocks that we've been talking about, the REITs and the banks, that are all of a sudden seeming like a better value, because, you know, from a risk/reward perspective.

Moser: Well, that's definitely understandable. I mean, I think we've all probably [laughs] been looking at the market this year, at least the second half of the year, and thinking, it's nice to see it doing so well. But yeah, valuations become more and more a concern. I think that you're right in that rotation point there, because we're not seeing necessarily any real discrimination here in the selling of a lot of these stay-at-home stocks. Amazon and Netflix being down, obviously Wayfair, these businesses are not going to stop doing what they're doing, right? These are businesses that are still very much going to be serving consumers in good times and in bad, so I think it's worth noting for investors. It's very easy to sit out there and talk about all the stay-at-home stock fad or whatever you might call it is over, but let's try to look a little bit beyond that. I mean, the stay-at-home stock concept on its own, I think, was a bit misguided and that was very short-term focused.

Stay-at-home isn't going to last forever, we knew that back at the beginning of the year. I would argue, if you're an analyst and you're surprised about what's happening today, you probably need to work on being a little bit of a better analyst. We've been seeing this and talking about it for a long time here, so this isn't a surprise. To me, the surprise would be, if folks were looking at a lot of these businesses and saying, oh, now their day in the sun is over. Amazon, Wayfair, Netflix, I mean, we don't need to worry about Etsy, another great example. It's not like people are going to stop shopping online, but there's a psychology behind some of this today.

Frankel: Yeah, for sure. No one thought this was going to last forever. The reason today's news is so significant is that it looks like it could be over sooner than we thought. And it's not just that this came sooner than we thought, we thought we were going to see some stage three trial data in November, but it looks like no one predicted a 90% effectiveness rating from the first vaccine candidate.

Moser: That was really encouraging. [laughs] Really encouraging news.

Frankel: And I don't know about you, but I've been reading, kind of, horror stories about the side effect potential of these vaccines. There was one article I read from some trial participants, I don't think it was in Pfizer's trial, where they said after the second shot, they were just on their bed for two days. So, it's not only 90% effective, but it's doing it without any significant side effects, which is, just on both sides, much better than anyone thought it would be.

So, no one thought it was lasting forever, but this is really giving them hope that the pandemic could actually become a thing of the past before too long, you know, we might not have to wear masks and I might be able to come see you in HQ before we thought it might happen.

Moser: Well, we will keep our fingers crossed. Like you said, there is plenty of work left to do, it does feel like this was really meaningful news today though; for a lot of reasons that you just noted right there. And so, you know, all we can do is, is continue to hope for the best. Of course, thank you to all of the brightest minds out there who are working so hard on our behalf to really help us, as not only as a country, but really as a world, as a global society to get past this, because it doesn't discriminate, you know, the virus, you can't stop it. Until you can actually come up with a vaccine, you can't do anything other than try to mitigate it and manage it, and that's what we've been doing at this point. But definitely good news. It seems like the market is receiving it very well.

By the same token, folks out there, don't let this just make you think that everything is hunky-dory and get back to normal, this is one more step in the right direction, but it sounds like there's still some work to do. We'll continue to follow it and we'll pay attention to the companies that matter to you most.

Speaking of the companies that matter to you most, Matt, let's drop this discussion for a few minutes and let's get into what happened last week, which was another slew of earnings. And we got to talk about all of these companies all week last week, we talked about some of them on Motley Fool Money last week as well. But there were a lot of companies in our space, the financial space, that reported earnings, and we want to get into them and talk a little bit about the quarters. We have a lot of them, so we're going to get to them, we've going to give them their due attention in quick fashion here.

But let's go ahead and start with, really, you know, this guy likes talking about elephant guns, let's talk about the elephant in the room here, Berkshire Hathaway. And I'll let you talk about this quarter, but I'll just tell you, I was amazed at how much stock they bought back.

Frankel: Yeah. And you just hit the nail on the head, that's the big headline, Berkshire bought back $9.3 billion worth of stock. I just wrote something about it on Fool.com today, because Berkshire actually takes it one step further than most companies and breaks down its purchases by month, by class of shares. So, whether it bought back the A. shares or the B shares, and the average price it paid per month.

So, remember that Berkshire can only buy back stock if Buffett and Charlie Munger both agree that it's trading cheaply at any given time. And the average purchase price in September, when they bought back the most stock out of that three-month period, was in the $216 range, which is even after today's move, is not that far from where it is now. So, that's them telling the market that even at that price, the stock was much cheaper than its intrinsic value and was a really good just investment in general.

Berkshire's operating businesses really didn't give us any big surprises. The company still has about $140 billion of cash even after that buyback that we just mentioned. And I am really looking forward to its 13-F coming out this weekend, because remember, we don't get to see what they did in their stock portfolio yet, they're going to release their 13-F filing, it's called, which they have to release 45 days after the quarter ends, which adds up to the 14 of the month. So, we'll see that soon.

We do know that Berkshire's cost basis in its stock portfolio went up by $9 billion during the quarter from this earnings report, and the only thing that we know they bought is about $2 billion of Bank of America stock. What's with that other $7 billion, what they buy is what I'm, kind of, curious about? [laughs]

Moser: [laughs] Yeah. Well, I feel like we'll be able to talk about that next week maybe. What do you think that disagreement between Buffett and Munger looks like? Whenever they're deliberating the intrinsic value of that stock and whether it's worth the repurchase, what do you think that disagrees ... do you think they ever really, like, vehemently just disagree with one another?

Frankel: Well, this quarter, it doesn't look like they disagreed much at all. [laughs] But in general, who would you say is the more conservative out of the two? I'd have to go with Munger.

Moser: Yeah, I think you're probably right. Yeah, I think that's right.

Frankel: So, they're both very conservative investors, which is why when they're buying back stock and sending the message that they think it's cheap, that's why I take it very, very seriously, because they're both very conservative investors. But I mean, I'm sure they do have their own little closed door, you know -- well, now they're doing it probably through Zoom, but they probably have an argument about what the company is really worth and all that. Obviously, they didn't argue too much this quarter, they bought back a whole lot of stock. That's almost 2% of the outstanding in one quarter, which is a pretty aggressive buyback.

Moser: That is aggressive. Well, you know, that tells you a lot right there, so that's worth keeping in mind, and we'll look forward to learning a little bit more about the equity moves here next week and beyond as well.

Matt, Square, not surprisingly, reported another very impressive quarter. It was one that I felt like, you know, after PayPal's quarter earlier in the week, it seemed like, you know, Square was set up to report some good numbers, and they didn't disappoint. There are a lot of numbers here that really make you feel like this business just continues to do a lot of good things. Total net revenue crossed the $3 billion mark, it was up 148% if you exclude Caviar, which they sold off a while back. What stood out to you in this most recent quarter for Square?

Frankel: Well, I've been following Square's brokerage efforts for a while, because I love the Cash App. The Cash App users doubled year-over-year, which is really impressive at this stage considering how big it is. The gross profit generated by the Cash App -- remember, we said a few times during the, kind of, earlier stages of monetization still, the gross profit generated by the Cash App nearly tripled year-over-year. Remember, they rolled out their stock trading feature on the Cash App, 2.5 million people had bought-and-sold stock on the Cash App as of the end of the third quarter. That's pretty impressive. I don't know the stats, but I'm sure when TD Ameritrade was invented, for example, they didn't get to 2.5 million that quick.

Moser: It's a lot. And they said billions of dollars have already been traded by the end of the third quarter. I saw that snippet and that was one that was something that really stood out to me as well.

Frankel: Yeah. And I mean, not only is their growth impressive, but it's accelerating. Over the past six, seven quarters, they've grown consistently at 30% to 40% year-over-year revenue pace, or I'm sorry, gross profit rather. Gross profit was up 63% this quarter, so not only are they still keeping their growth trajectory alive, but it's kind of like, it's going kind of parabolic right now. [laughs]

So, Square is pretty impressive. I bought Square a while ago, I never really envisioned it would turn into what it has, I just thought it was a really interesting payment processing platform, to be honest with you. And my only problem with Square is that I didn't buy more back in 2015 or whenever the IPO was.

Moser: [laughs] Yeah. Clearly, I have been a very happy shareholder as well; my daughters own shares, they feel pretty good about that. I can't say that I found, really, anything in the quarter that concerned me. One thing to note, and this is not a mark against them, as a matter of fact, I think I really actually credit them for this, they're going to ramp up investments in the business next year. Talking about 2021, they're talking about ramping up investments in the business around 40% from this year. And that will impact profitability to the extent that revenue growth is impacted. So, we want to pay attention to that topline. The investments in the business could certainly play out on profitability. Again, that seems like a short-term thing in order to ensure the longer term success of the business, but you know, you keep those types of things in mind, because a company that's going to spend like that, who knows what the psychology of the market is going to be in 2021, but maybe that opens up a window to add to that position if the chance arises.

Frankel: Yeah, for sure. I've considered pulling the trigger on some more Square for a long time, including in March when it was down in the $30s for a brief time, then I just got cold feet. I'm learning my lesson with Square over-and-over that, you know, keep adding to your winners. [laughs] One of these days I'll actually take my own advice and do it. When I can stop talking about it for a few days, because that also has to happen.

Moser: Yeah, that's one of our hurdles, but hopefully, listeners that are listening, taking your advice into consideration. Well, another one of our favorite payments companies here that reported last week, PayPal. You know, I mentioned that I wasn't surprised with Square's numbers, because PayPal had lobbed up such a great quarter earlier in the week.

And to your point there in regard to the user growth, the thing that stood out to me, and I went back a couple of calls to really confirm this, because when I saw what I saw on the release, I thought, wait a minute, what? Because that sounded like it was a much larger number than what they had initially guided for, and it was. If you go back to January of this year during the fourth quarter earnings call, management had set the target in that call for 2020 to add approximately 35 million net new active accounts. In this quarter three release, Matt, they upped that guidance. They now see adding 70 million net new active accounts for the year. So, essentially what's been going on all year long has more or less doubled the user growth that they had projected back at the beginning of the year. And to no one's surprise, they raised guidance pretty much across the board.

Frankel: Well, what's really standing out to me is, I wasn't surprised that they added a ton of users, say, in the second quarter when everything was shut down and people were only shopping online and that kind of thing. What really surprised me is they kept that momentum going into the third quarter, when for the most part, everything has reopened. So, they added over 15 million users in the third quarter alone, so I'm not surprised they raised their full-year guidance like that. And that they're keeping that momentum alive and, kind of, really building out their base even [laughs] when the economy is reopening. So, that really stood out to me.

Just a stat to show you just how big PayPal has gotten. They processed $247 billion of payments this quarter, that is almost $1 trillion of volume flowing through PayPal's system on an annual basis. That's about 10X what Square is doing, by the way. So, this is huge. And that's pretty much only online, they're not really in the brick-and-mortar space to a big extent.

Moser: Yeah, not to that extent. I mean, they added over 1.5 million merchants for the quarter; they now have 28 million total. The thing that I was really impressed with, Venmo continues to gain a lot of traction. 65 million users drove +$44 billion in total payment volume; that was up 61%. Forecasting $900 million in Venmo revenue in 2021, but the thing that really stood out to me was that Venmo, in 2021, will contribute positively to transaction margin dollars. So, we've been talking about this a lot, we've got listener questions in regard to Venmo on profitability. It sounds like 2021, where your profitable Venmo is, from what I could gather.

Frankel: Yeah. So, Venmo is obviously something Square doesn't have. I call that a big differentiator for PayPal. Just the Venmo and PayPal ecosystem is kind of ahead of where Square and Cash App is right now, I would call it. That may change. Square is trying to be a little different with its Cash App than PayPal is with Venmo. I mean, I don't think -- correct me if I'm wrong -- but I don't think PayPal has mentioned the need to, desire to put a stock trading platform on Venmo or to put bitcoin capability into it or anything like that ...

Moser: Yeah, not to my knowledge.

Frankel: So, it's two different animals. And PayPal, they're trying to build out the payment network. Square is trying to be, kind of, an all-in-one financial company for everybody. So, that's kind of the -- I mean, they can both coexist, they serve different use cases, and there's a lot of room for both of them to keep growing from this point. $1 trillion is not a ton when you think that the global card payment volume is in the $40 trillion to $50 trillion range. So, I mean, don't let that $1 trillion number scare you into thinking that PayPal has done growing.

Moser: Very good point, very good point. Yeah, I totally agree. It seems like there's still plenty of wide-open space ahead for both companies to capture. You know, another company that we talk about on the show here, and a company that I featured recently in the show when we talked about the stocks that we were going to buy next, Bill.com.

Bill.com reported for the quarter, and it was, again, another quarter of just what looked like impressive growth. Total revenue was $42.1 million, it was up 33% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. We saw a nice little bump up in gross margin thanks to the business scaling and more volume going through the system. They serve 98,000 customers at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, that was growth of 28%. Processed $25.4 billion in total payment volume on the platform in the quarter; that was up 26% from the year ago, and processed 5.6 million transactions for the quarter. At the end of the quarter they had 2.5 million network members; that was up almost 40% from the year ago.

So, again, for a business that's really focused on that small- to medium-sized business demographic and helping tighten up back office operations, eliminate paper, create more efficiencies using that artificial intelligence, as a shareholder in Bill.com I was certainly very encouraged by that quarter.

Speaking of businesses that we each follow pretty closely, Matt, Green Dot also announced earnings last week, tell me how that quarter went?

Frankel: Well, it was pretty good actually. Their revenue was up about 21% year-over-year, beating their own expectations. The primary driver of increasing revenue is, well, there's two actually, there's stimulus checks, which kind of prompted a whole lot, because they do prepaid debit cards. That's one of their big businesses; that prompted a whole lot of usage of those products. But their Banking-as-a-Service platform, which they let companies like Apple, and Intuit, and Uber use as, kind of, their banking network, because they are a chartered bank, unlike a lot of the fintechs we followed, let them use their infrastructure to offer their own banking products to their customers and employees. Like the feature that allows Uber drivers to instantly get paid is powered by Green Dot. So, that revenue was up.

And the real key thing to mention is that that's where you really want to see the growth momentum in Green Dot, because that's the higher margin of their revenue. So, that's growing, their margins are up, their margin expanded by 100 basis points year-over-year actually. The new CEO who took over a couple of quarters ago, Dan Henry, is doing a fantastic job. And I know everybody was rolling their eyes at me every time I mentioned Green Dot when it was down in the $20s earlier this year, and he's done a great job of turning the ship around since then and really focusing efforts on the Banking-as-a-Service offerings, which is where he should be focusing.

Moser: Yeah. And you know, Green Dot was dealing with its fair share of challenges earlier on, but it's really been a tremendous year for the stock. I know that the listeners appreciate you having been able to keep up with them, because they've made a lot of progress, and patient shareholders are really being rewarded in exercising that patience now. So, it's great to see that success with Green Dot.

What about MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI), Matt? This is a company that we've often referred to as the Amazon of Latin America. To me, that is just such a small part of the story, it feels like when you look at the actual -- the fintech operations or the payment operations that they have there, not to mention things like fulfillment, logistics, and whatnot. But I mean, another just tremendous quarter from -- well, let's just call it, the Amazon of Latin America, right. [laughs]

Frankel: [laughs] Yeah. Well, I call them, like, the Amazon and Square of Latin America all-in-one, is kind of how I would put it. Because there's really two sides to their business, there's the e-commerce platform, which is the Amazon of Latin America, and then there is the payments platform, MercadoPago, which is, you know, kind of the Square or PayPal, if you will, of Latin America. The growth on both sides of the business was extremely impressive.

This is not Amazon where it's a really mature e-commerce marketplace, this is still in the earlier stages of growth. So, I'll call this, like, Amazon, you know, circa 2005, if I had to put a year on it. On the e-commerce side of the business, the gross merchandise volume sold on the platform was up to 117%, so that more than doubled year-over-year. 205 million items were sold on the platform, which sounds like a lot, but go look up how much Amazon sold on its platform and it'll seem like a tiny number.

On the payment side of the business, that's where it gets really impressive, they did $14.5 billion U.S. equivalent in payment volume, which as we just mentioned PayPal's numbers, that's about one-twentieth [5%] of what PayPal does. But it's growing at an off the charts pace, 161% year-over-year payments volume growth. And the best part is, that the payment volume that came from off of its e-commerce platform is growing even faster, that tripled year-over-year.

It's easy enough for MercadoLibre to promote its payments platform to people already selling on its platform. So, think of this as, you know, eBay getting people to use PayPal back when they were both the same company. But it was tougher for PayPal to get people who weren't on eBay to use their platform, and that's kind of what you're seeing MercadoLibre doing a great job of right now.

I became a shareholder during the pandemic, and I'd been meaning to pull the trigger on that one for years. I wish I had listened to myself a few years ago, but better late than never. And the recent results show me that this is still in the early stages.

Moser: Yeah. And, you know, I think for me, when I look at MercadoLibre, to me, it really is all about the boom in Latin America's middle class. And I think even the room that they have still to run there. I mean, if you look at the numbers between 2008 and 2018, Latin America's middle class expanded from 33 million households to 46 million households. And making up a far greater proportion of the overall household as well. It seems like that number is poised to continue growing, which obviously speaks volumes for the opportunity in front of MercadoLibre.

Do you think, and I tend to probably think not, but do you think there is ever the chance that they would spin that payment side of the business out as its own separate publicly traded company or do you feel like they would be better off keeping that in-house?

Frankel: For the time being, they should keep it in-house. I mentioned the PayPal-eBay example, I think when it becomes kind of a more mature business like PayPal and eBay, where the growth within the platform is kind of limited at that point, things like that, then it might be worth looking at spinning it out. But for right now, it's a very valuable asset that they're doing a great job of growing alongside their core business.

Moser: Yep, yep, it makes sense. Well, before we wrap things up, Matt, let's give our listeners one to watch for the coming week. What's your one to watch this coming week?

Frankel: Well, this is my -- when we did the recent stocks we want... you mentioned Bill.com, I'm going with Lemonade, which reports its earnings on Wednesday. That was my recent stock I bought. This will be their first earnings report as a publicly traded company. The performance has been pretty good for the stock right now. I want to see if their business results are backing that up, if they're still growing like I think they're capable of, and if management is still making the right moves. So, I'll report back next week after they report their earnings, but that's what I'm keeping my eye on this week.

Moser: Nice. Well, I'll go with a company that's a little bit less financial -- it's not directly financials related, but it is a company that is very much tied to the consumer, and one that's been dealing with a lot of, not bad news, but just a difficult situation. Disney earnings come out later this week on Thursday, clearly, they've been, you know, on the [laughs] one side of coin with their focus on streaming and entertainment, I mean, the business has really done very well. The flip side of the coin there is that, you know, the parks have been closed. And that has been a real anchor, particularly with what's going on in California. I mean, they can't get anything going out there.

You know, you were telling me the story, you guys went down there recently to Disney World, Orlando and it sounded like they were taking things very seriously and had a pretty good thing going there. So, it was encouraging to see that they were able, at least, to get some traffic going there. But the stock responding to this vaccine news today, obviously, very positively. Stock, right now as we're taping up, about 12%, [laughs] that's a big move for a company like Disney. So, I'm going to be very encouraged to see what their language is like on that call regarding this vaccine news and the state of the Park's business in general, so I'll be keeping an eye on that.

But, Matt, I think that is going to wrap it up for us this week. We had a little bit of a long show today. We had a lot to talk about. Man, I appreciate you sitting in and taking care of us today.

Frankel: I'm enjoying watching all the real estate stocks go up. You know, I'm the advisor on our new Real Estate Winners service, Real.Fool.com, if anyone wants to check it out. But, I mean, it's a great day for REITs, so we're having a fantastic time watching it today. Some of our Real Estate Winners they're really living up to their names.

Moser: [laughs] That's terrific. Well, man, more power to you, and I hope the ball keeps on going in that direction for you.

Many names that hit fresh highs a few weeks ago are in the market doghouse right now, but quality will eventually win the day on Wall Street.

Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG), DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG), and Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) are three stocks that have recently fallen at least 20% below their earlier highs. These are names that I expect will recover quickly. Here's why I'm bullish on these three briefly out-of-favor investments.

Datadog

One of this year's bigger winners reported fresh financials this week, and Wall Street wasn't impressed. Shares of the cloud-based provider of website uptime tracking, security monitoring, and a growing suite of analytical tools declined 6% on Wednesday after posting its third-quarter results, and the stock is now 26% below the all-time high it hit just four weeks ago.

The quarter had everything you would expect in an applause-worthy performance. The 61% increase in revenue and adjusted profit of $0.05 a share were comfortably ahead of the 50% top-line growth and $0.01 a share in net income that analysts targeted. Datadog boosted its outlook for all of 2020, and the guidance it initiated for the current quarter is also above where the pros are parked.

Datadog's streak of dollar-based net retention rate above 130% (the rate of returning customers who are spending at least 30% more on Datadog's offerings than a year before) now stretches to 13 consecutive quarters. Bears can argue that Datadog's valuation was stretched when it peaked last month, but with revenue growth outpacing expectations, the bullish counter is that the multiple will keep retracting organically even as the stock bounces back in the near future.

DraftKings

I have a love-hate relationship with DraftKings as an investment, but there's no denying that it's the top dog in wagering on fantasy sports. More importantly, DraftKings is using that pole position as a Trojan horse to get its more traditional sportsbook betting platform into our heads. DraftKings has been brokering deals with leading sports networks, and it's going to pay off a lot sooner than you think.

Investors were hopping onto DraftKings stock over the summer and early fall as pro sports leagues across the country restarted their seasons, but investors who once bet on DraftKings are now wagering against the niche leader. The stock has fallen 35% since its early October highs as of Wednesday's close, and it's well positioned to crank out a blowout quarterly report on Friday morning. Revenue rose 24% for the quarter that ended in June, and that was without any of the major leagues in action. This is a classic pullback that could bounce back later this week if it's able to deliver a strong financial update.

Fastly

The hardest-hit of the three stocks here is Fastly. The next-gen content delivery network ranked as one of this year's biggest winners until it lowered its guidance four weeks ago, largely as a result of losing Tiktok as its largest customer.

Investors bailed on Fastly, which lost nearly half of its value after declining in 12 of the last 13 trading days of October. Fastly is now trading 47% below the all-time high it established in mid-October. Whenever a company slashes its guidance, it's going to raise red flags. Datadog this week showed us that even increasing your guidance sometimes isn't good enough.

However, the end result here is that Fastly is now roughly half the company it was a month ago in terms of market valuation. Even if TikTok doesn't come back -- and it was a big part of the business, constituting nearly 11% of its revenue through the first nine months of 2020 -- analysts see revenue growing by at least 30% in 2021.

Datadog, DraftKings, and Fastly are down -- but none of them is out.",draftkings,dkng,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.822, 'pos': 0.178, 'compound': 0.5795}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.822, 'pos': 0.178, 'compound': 0.5795}]",0.28975,0.0,0.28975,0.19316666666666668,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Positive,Neutral,Somewhat Positive
