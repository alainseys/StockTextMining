Since DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) relies on its customers to make wagers on the outcome of sporting events, the lack of sports hurt the company significantly.

Fortunately, the NBA, MLB, and NFL all resumed their seasons after the months-long hiatus. When DraftKings reports its earnings on Nov. 13, shareholders will find out if there was pent-up demand to engage in wagering on sporting events.

Regaining momentum as sports leagues restarted

Investors will first want to look at the company's overall revenue growth. In the most recent quarter, it was 25%, which is quite impressive given how much the coronavirus pandemic plagued sports leagues. Assuming no major sports cancellations, the company expects to grow revenue by 30% at the midpoint for the second half of fiscal 2020. The NBA and MLB were already able to complete their seasons and crown the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Dodgers, respectively, as champions. Still, with coronavirus cases surging to record highs in the U.S., it remains to be seen if the NFL and other major sports can do the same.

Next, those interested in the stock will want to know more about gambling legalization and its increasing availability in various states. According to DraftKings, as of Sept. 1, its Sportsbook app and website are available in Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The company's standalone casino app is also live in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The more states that legalize, the larger the total addressable market becomes for DraftKings. It is also important to note that state budgets have become strained by the pandemic. Legalizing online sports betting is one way states can fill budget gaps without relying on the federal government to pass a stimulus bill.

Finally, shareholders should look at the company's reported monthly unique player (MUP) base and growth. This figure is especially important for the company's daily fantasy sports segment. The more players who enter an event, the larger the prize pool, which then attracts even more players to enter. This positive virtuous cycle is one reason the figure is so important to shareholders. During the six months ended June 30, the company had 507,628 MUPs, which was down from 537,142 from a year ago. The suspension of major sports leagues during the period probably had a say in that drop.

What it could mean for investors

Wall Street's average expectation is for DraftKings to report revenue of $132 million and a net loss per share of $0.61. The company also stated that it expects to report revenue of $132 million at the midpoint when it updated the prospectus for an additional stock offering on Oct 6. The figure would be an increase of 97% from the prior year.

DraftKings is continuing on its path as a high-flying growth stock, but the risk remains that major sports leagues will pause their seasons, setting the company back again. However, it does have over $1.2 billion of cash and no debt on the balance sheet to weather that storm if it needs to.",draftkings,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.794, 'pos': 0.206, 'compound': 0.0772}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.0,0.0386,0.0,0.012866666666666667,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral

Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) and the S&P 500 index (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) gained over 7% over the five trading days. The Dow is now roughly flat for the year, while the S&P is up 9%.

A few widely followed companies will announce earnings results over the next few trading days, including Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), and DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG). Below we'll take a look at the key trends that might send the stocks for these three companies moving this week.

1. Beyond Meat's competitive outlook

Investors are optimistic heading into Beyond Meat's Monday earnings report. The plant-based meat substitute maker announced strong sales growth in the early days of the pandemic, revealing in August that second-quarter revenue jumped 69% year over year as sales to retailers offset plunging demand from restaurant chains.

Since then its growth prospects have remained impressive. Beyond Meat recently announced expanded distribution of its core products through Walmart, for one. It also added Beyond-branded sausage links to its portfolio, which joined plant-based sausage patties and meatballs as popular 2020 launches.

Those actions have investors predicting continued strong sales growth through the rest of the year. But Beyond Meat will also have to contend with extra competition from traditional meat producers like Tyson Foods and retailers like Kroger as it seeks to maintain its early lead in this attractive food niche.

2. McDonald's operating margin

Investors already know that McDonald's will have some good operating news to announce on Monday. The fast-food titan said in a mid-quarter update that it returned to sales growth in the core U.S. market in recent weeks following a 9% year-over-year decline in fiscal Q2.

But this week's report will add important context to that revenue figure, including the breakdown between customer traffic, which fell, and average order spending, which is surging.

Meanwhile, Starbucks said in late October that profitability fell due to the shift in demand toward delivery services and the aggressive use of promotions aimed at keeping customers engaged with the brand even as they stay closer to home. McDonald's will likely announce some similar margin pressures as it looks ahead to a potential full-growth rebound in late 2020 or early 2021.

3. DraftKings' demand trends

Investors have endured a roller-coaster ride with DraftKings' stock heading into Friday's earnings report. The volatility is likely to continue for this unproven consumer discretionary stock.

Besides the share price surge through most of the year, major investor concerns include a surprising decline in viewership for sporting events in recent months and the potential for further event pauses due to COVID-19 outbreaks. And DraftKings' business would be heavily impacted by a recession, should one take hold in the U.S. market.

Executives won't have much clarity to offer about the wider economic environment on Friday, but look for CEO Jason Robins and his team to explain how they see sports viewing demand, and growing market access, impacting the business into early 2021. Management should also update investors on their plans for using the cash they raised from a recent stock offering as part of DraftKings' big-picture strategy to build a profitable sports-betting business.",draftkings,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.429, 'neu': 0.571, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.128}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.429, 'neu': 0.571, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.128}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",-0.042666666666666665,0.0,-0.042666666666666665,-0.028444444444444442,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral

Even those consumers who aren't afraid of gathering in a large crowd may still be leery of splurging.

There are some entertainment names, however, that are not only surviving in this challenging economic environment, but thriving in it. Others are positioning smartly for the recovery that should take shape once the COVID-19 pandemic is finally over.

Sony (NYSE:SNE), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) are among those names worth considering right now as stock investments. Let's find out a bit more about these three entertainment stocks.

1. Sony

You may see Sony as the long-time maker of tape recorders, television sets, and camcorders, but Sony is so much more than that these days. In fact, consumer electronics only make up about a fourth of the company's revenue. Another fourth comes from its video gaming business centered around PlayStation consoles. Cameras, movie production, and music publishing each make up around 12% of Sony's top line, while its financial services arm drives roughly 16% of its sales.

This revenue diversity has not only allowed Sony to smooth out erratic sales and earnings, but it also gives the company opportunities to focus on what's working well.

The real game-changer as we head out of 2020 and into 2021, however, is a reinvigorated gaming industry.

Ratings agency Nielsen reported earlier this year that at the peak of lockdowns, 82% of the world's consumers were playing video games of some sort. Even as recently as August, U.S. consumer spending on video games and hardware was up 37% year over year, according to market research firm NPD Group. And the company specifically noted that its subscription-based video game service had seen decided growth in recent months. With the launch of Sony's next-generation PlayStation 5 console slated for later this month, the company should see strong demand from now-hooked gamers who may be on the hunt for something newer and better. Sony says it's aiming to outsell the PlayStation 4 in its first year of launch, which saw the purchase of 7.6 million units. That's huge.

The clincher: The version of the PlayStation 5 that doesn't come with a disc drive not only costs $100 less than the disc-drive version that will retail for $499, but it will also steer consumers toward Sony's online menu of game downloads. Those digital downloads generally mean higher margins on game sales.

2. Comcast

Most investors think Comcast is primarily a cable television company, and as such, a name to steer clear of. Cord-cutting is killing the business segment. That line of thinking is flawed, though.

Yes, Comcast is the owner of cable brand Xfinity, which lost another 273,000 customers last quarter. That brings the two-year attrition tally to nearly 2 million people who've canceled their Xfinity cable service.

But cable is only a fraction of Comcast's business, and the company is adding subscribers to a much more important and much more profitable offering. Last quarter's $5.4 billion worth of cable revenue only accounted for 22% of the company's top line, and during the same quarter, it added 633,000 new high-speed internet customers. It's added over 3 million broadband subscribers in just the past couple of years, and the internet-customer relationship is one that can be leveraged in a lot of ways, like offering wireless phone service or ad-supported streaming TV.

Yes, Comcast continues to hurt in other ways. It's also the owner of NBCUniversal, which is a TV and film presence. NBC is on the wrong side of the cord-cutting movement, and theaters have been shut down for the better part of the year.

Comcast is adapting on those fronts too, however. Its ad-supported streaming platform, Peacock, now boasts 22 million viewers since its public debut in mid-July, and while it's not yet the new norm, Universal has found respectable success in bypassing theaters and selling new films directly to consumers.

Comcast can survive a shrinking cable TV market.

3. Caesars Entertainment

Finally, add Caesars Entertainment to your list of entertainment stocks to buy.

It's suffered its fair share of problems in 2020. Just when it looked like the company might be able to shrug of the impact and drama related to its 2015 bankruptcy and subsequent restructuring, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the casino and resort industry in a hurry. The United States gambling business contracted 79% during the second quarter of the year, according to the American Gaming Association.

The company is using the slow time to maneuver for what the world may look like once the pandemic is in the rearview mirror. In September, it confirmed a $3.7 billion bid for U.K.-based bookmaker William Hill (OTC:WIMHY), and just a couple of weeks before that, it entered into a joint venture with Walt Disney's ESPN and DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG). Both deals put Caesars Entertainment in a better position to plug into a fragmented but fast-growing sports betting and online gambling market that could be worth $150 billion per year.

To this end, three more U.S. states legalized sports betting with last week's election, bringing the total to 25.
