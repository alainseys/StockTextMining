Shares of DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) sank 39.8% in October, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The online betting company's stock fell after a large share sale valuing the company significantly lower than previous highs.

DraftKings, which had its initial public offering in April, sold 32 million shares on Oct. 7 at at a price of $52 per share. The $1.6 billion sale, which saw half of shares sold by DraftKings and half by investors, raised roughly $830 million in funds for the company. That valuation came in significantly below the stock's closing price of $56.79 the day before the new offering, and shares continued to move lower as the month progressed.

So what

The potential for additional share offerings and dilution likely caused DraftKings stock to continue trending lower following the Oct. 7 sale. The company had roughly 376 million shares outstanding after the new stock offering, with roughly half of the company's shares being owned by insiders and the other half being freely tradable. The company's share price may have also faced additional pressure in the lead up to, and following, an unspecified amount of insider-held stock becoming tradable on Oct. 20.

DraftKings likely also felt the impact from coronavirus-related pressures last month. Postponement for some NFL games due to confirmed cases of COVID-19 among some players and staff elevated the risk that the season would be disrupted, but it looks like those potential issues have been resolved through rescheduling.

Now what

DraftKings stock has regained some ground early in November's trading. Shares are up roughly 6% in the month so far.

The market for online betting has big room for growth, but DraftKings' future will be shaped by an uncertain regulatory climate and the prospect of tough competition even if lawmakers take soft stances on the industry.

Why DraftKings Stock Is Up 5% Today,Motley Fool,4 days ago,"Shares of fantasy sports and sports betting app DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) jumped 9% at the market open today, and are up more than 5% as of 11:25 a.m. ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/04/why-draftkings-stock-is-up-5-today/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","What happened

Shares of fantasy sports and sports betting app DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) jumped 9% at the market open today, and are up more than 5% as of 11:25 a.m. EST. Sports betting ballot initiatives were passed in three more states in yesterday's election.

The approvals bring the total to 21 states and Washington, D.C., where sports betting is legal in the U.S.

So what

Voters in Maryland, Louisiana, and South Dakota are the latest to legalize in-person and/or online sports betting in their states.

As more states legalize sports betting, the line between online betting and retail sportsbooks is getting blurred. DraftKings and competitor FanDuel have been increasing partnerships with brick-and-mortar casinos to expand offerings.

Now what

DraftKings now has casino partners in eight states. It also has an agreement with Turner Sports, giving it the rights to display its fantasy sports and sports betting content on select Turner Sports and Bleacher Report television programs.

DraftKings has been a popular growth stock since its IPO in April 2020, even though the COVID-19 pandemic has limited sporting events significantly. Its shares have more than doubled since that time.

The continued wave of states allowing sports betting could result in a $58 billion market, when you include online casino gambling, according to Needham analyst Brad Erickson. Besides FanDuel, DraftKings competitors include MGM Resorts International and Penn National Gaming, both of which combine online apps with a physical casino presence.",draftkings,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.925, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': 0.296}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.925, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': 0.296}]",0.296,0.0,0.296,0.19733333333333333,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Positive,Neutral,Somewhat Positive

Shares of DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) climbed 9% on Thursday after voters in three more states approved measures to legalize sports betting.

So what

Maryland, South Dakota, and Louisiana will soon allow bets to be placed on sporting events. They'll join 21 other states that already allow such wagers. As a leading daily fantasy sports contest and sports betting platform, DraftKings -- and its investors -- stand to profit handsomely from these developments.

Now what

The pace of legalization appears set to accelerate in the coming year, as more states turn to sports betting to help shore up tax revenue bases depleted during the COVID-19 crisis. In turn, the online sports betting and gambling market could eventually generate $58 billion in annual revenue in the U.S. alone, according to some analysts.

DraftKings has moved aggressively to make the most of this tantalizing growth opportunity. The hard-charging company has struck deals with ESPN and multiple sports teams in recent months -- all of which are designed to keep its brand top of mind among bettors. DraftKings is also flush with cash after its recent share offerings, which should give it the capital it needs to continue heavy investments in its growth initiatives.",draftkings,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.661, 'pos': 0.339, 'compound': 0.4767}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.661, 'pos': 0.339, 'compound': 0.4767}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.23835,0.0,0.23835,0.1589,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Positive,Neutral,Somewhat Positive
Should You Buy Caesars Before There's a Coronavirus Vaccine?,Motley Fool,5 days ago,"... at only $3.8 billion by investors, 15% of online sports betting company DraftKings' (NASDAQ:DKNG) value, yet has the same revenue potential as DraftKings.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/03/should-you-buy-caesars-before-theres-a-coronavirus/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Despite rolling ""snake eyes"" when the coronavirus pandemic caused lockdowns throughout the U.S. earlier this year, gambling companies are showing signs of life as many states begin to allow limited reopening of casinos. Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) saw a 22% rebound in September, likely related both to its ESPN partnership and its announced acquisition plans for English sportsbook company William Hill (LSE:WMH).

While Caesars isn't faring badly in its recovery, its stock still hasn't regained the full value it had before the coronavirus struck. Additionally, the rise of COVID-19 hospitalizations could be threatening another wave of lockdowns and an abrupt drop in the modest gains made by in-casino gambling during the summer months. With the earliest possible release of COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. still roughly two months away, according to a recent estimate from Dr. Anthony Fauci, Fools investing in consumer discretionary stocks might want to weigh several factors before buying shares of Caesars.

The current situation for casinos

While casinos have made a partial comeback from the disastrous days of March, April, and May, potential storm clouds still lurk on the horizon for physical casino locations. The Nevada Gaming Control Board reports total gaming win for August 2020 was down 22.08% year over year, while, for September 2020, total gaming win fell 22.38% compared to the year-ago figure. On the Las Vegas Strip itself, gaming win plunged 39.14% year over year.

The difference in lost Nevada gaming win between August and September is only slight, but it shows the recovery has plateaued, at least for the time being, and could even potentially reverse if a new outbreak intensifies. Additionally, while the metrics only show the gaming win from a single state, Nevada is a good barometer of legal gambling activity throughout the U.S. Nevada's gross gaming revenue (GGR) of $12 billion in 2019 dwarfed the second-largest state GGR, $3.5 billion in New Jersey, and accounted for 27.5% of the $43.6 billion national GGR, according to Statista research.

Furthermore, COVID-19 could be winding up to deliver another economic blow to the hospitality and gambling industry. The Week reports that hospitalizations are setting new records in 13 U.S. states, and while Nevada is not among them, the trend could still scare off potential visitors and depress leisure travel's recovery. More than 1,000 people in the U.S. are dying daily from the coronavirus again, too, potentially making physical visits to casinos and resorts less attractive, even with beefed-up sanitation and social distancing.

Nevada itself isn't yet breaking its previous records, but cases there have also shown a sharp recent upswing. The key market for Caesars' in-casino revenue is currently in a ""red zone,"" with rising infection rates and moderate to high levels of community transmission in 71% of Nevada counties.

How is Caesars holding up?

Caesars' third-quarter results are due out Nov. 5 and will provide a clearer picture of its current situation, but enough information is available now to get decent understanding of the company's position. Beyond the fluff of bringing live entertainment back to the Strip and other marketing gestures, the company has several important strengths likely to come into play in the medium to long term.

The July merger of Eldorado Resorts and Caesars into the single Caesars Entertainment entity created a massive enterprise, the biggest casino company in the U.S., with a presence in 16 states and approximately 55 properties, with eight located on the Las Vegas Strip. Combining the two companies should allow the newly minted Caesars to cut expenses by $500 million within the first year after closing, or in other words by July 2021, according to executive statements.

Placing all of the geographically far-flung properties of the two entities under a single management structure will almost certainly allow CEO Tom Reeg to eliminate a lot of redundancy and administrative bloat. According to some forecasts, the larger, leaner casino could see revenue exceed $8.75 billion, amounting to a 114% increase, once the brake of COVID-19's economic effect is released.

Caesars is also diversifying its strategic approach with an aggressive push into digital sports betting, one of 2020's major growth sectors. Caesars recently bought online bookmaker William Hill, and an analysis by casino investment bank Union Gaming suggests the market may be seriously undervaluing the acquisition's potential. The research claims the William Hill purchase is being valued at only $3.8 billion by investors, 15% of online sports betting company DraftKings' (NASDAQ:DKNG) value, yet has the same revenue potential as DraftKings.

Even if Union Gaming's specific estimates are ignored, Caesars said in a press release it made the acquisition based on a ""compelling strategic rationale,"" driven by such factors as ""a potential total addressable market size ranging up to $30-35 billion."" It also cited its ability to completely develop William Hill's American sports betting and online betting operations by merging them into its own, meshing them with Caesars' exclusive partnerships with a range of sports teams, and giving Caesars' 60 million-strong loyalty members immediate access to wagering through William Hill, where legal.

Sports betting, including online forms, has shown vigorous growth over the past few years, and extremely strong gains in 2020. According to Zion Market Research, the sector could see an 8.83% compound annual growth rate through 2024, rising to approximately $155 billion by that year.

To buy or not to buy

Buying stock in Caesars Entertainment before there's a COVID-19 vaccine seems like a potentially rewarding move for those interested in casino investments. In fact, with COVID-19 keeping Caesars' share price near or below pre-pandemic levels for the moment, this could be viewed as a buying opportunity. Caesars proved its ability to reach higher prices even before many of the benefits of its recent moves -- including the merger and its William Hill acquisition -- entered completely into the equation.

The true potential of many 2020 developments will be fully unlocked once COVID-19 is controlled by a vaccine. Today's larger, more efficient Caesars, with casinos and other properties in 16 U.S. states and abroad, is well-positioned to meet pent-up demand both in Las Vegas and beyond, once resort and gambling demand returns to full strength. In the meantime, its robust entry into the explosively growing digital sportsbook market taps another major revenue source, one immune to COVID-19 and likely to continue growing even in a post-coronavirus world.

When that day arrives, those who added the casino company to their portfolio before the vaccine will likely see a significant jump in the value of their holdings, perhaps even as high as the $100 per share predicted by some analysts, making this a good stock to consider buying now.",draftkings,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.906, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': 0.34}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.906, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': 0.34}]",0.34,0.0,0.34,0.22666666666666668,Somewhat Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive
Worried About a Stock Market Crash? 5 Steps to Take Right Now,Motley Fool,2 days ago,"DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) wasn't on many investors' radars, for instance, at the end of last year. But, with shutdowns forcing millions of people to stay at home ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/06/worried-about-a-stock-market-crash-5-steps-to-take/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","If you're worried the foreseeable future could be rough on stocks, you're not alone. Members of both of the country's major political parties are fairly confident ""the other guy"" will prove problematic for the economy if he is elected president of the United States. Plus, a resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic led to record-breaking levels of new cases last month. Another round of pandemic-related shutdowns may be ahead, and it's not clear if the fragile U.S. economy can handle it.

If you're more convinced than not that action has to be taken sooner than later with your investment portfolio to account for these uncertainties, here are five common-sense moves you can make right now to shield your portfolio from a potential implosion.

1. Shed your weakest, most speculative holdings

Investors have a tendency think -- and act -- a little more aggressively the longer a rally lasts, leading them to make bets they might not make early on in an expansion period. DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) wasn't on many investors' radars, for instance, at the end of last year. But, with shutdowns forcing millions of people to stay at home and find new sources of entertainment, the sports betting platform has been all the rage despite its lack of profitability and sky-high valuation of nearly 40 times its trailing revenue.

Hype and gains may have prompted traders to look past those details at the time, but a crash sparked by an actual economic contraction could cause these bettors to tighten their purse strings.

2. Beef up exposure all-weather stocks

While costly hobbies like sports betting may be the first to suffer should the market environment turn ugly, there are some consumer goods -- like food and personal hygiene supplies -- most people won't stop purchasing. That bodes well for brands like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Clorox (NYSE:CLX). The former is the name behind Pampers diapers, Tide detergent, and Gillette razors. The latter is of course the supplier of (among other things) a popular brand of bleach.

Note that all stock sell-offs have the potential to drag down all names, particularly when they first get going. Investors' worries are wide-sweeping when the initial shock of a correction sets in, and the selling can be indiscriminate. Eventually, though, the market starts to sort out the names that are truly impacted and the ones that are better defended from potential economic woes.

3. Buy some (cheap) put options

If you're not versed in equity or index options, now's not the time to start figuring them out. In simplest terms, a call option is a bet on price appreciation, while a put option is a bet on falling prices for a stock or index. There are nuances to puts and calls, however, that can make them tricky to trade. (There's also the not-so-small fact that your broker must approve you for options trading, which can take time.)

If you've worked with options before, however, this might be the time to step into some puts -- the cheaper, the better.

Why lower-cost options? The obvious answer is that right now, they cost less, which means you can commit less capital to such a trade. In this case, though, you also want cheap put options because this position will only serve as a sort of insurance policy you don't actually want to use. The purpose in this situation is only to shield yourself from a major setback for a finite period of time. If you buy them and are them unable to exercise them because the market never crashes, that's not necessarily a bad thing.

Tip: Don't try and hedge an entire portfolio from a market crash just using options. Just curbing some of the impact of a steep sell-off is still a win.

4. Go for the gold

Gold and other precious metals should be a part of most diversified portfolios, as these commodities are not correlated well with equities. Basically, when stocks are underperforming, there's a good chance other investments like gold are outperforming. Ditto for bonds.

This inverse relationship isn't etched in stone, for the record. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEMKT:GLD) fell with the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) in late February and early March when the pandemic first took hold. The two recovered in tandem beginning with March's reversal as well. That's more of an exception to the norm than the norm itself, though. The reverse correlation is at least reliable enough to make gold a decent hedge if a crash is inevitable from here.

5. Take a breath, and keep it in perspective

Finally, bear in mind that just because the financial media has led you to believe a market meltdown is brewing doesn't necessarily make it so. As the old cliche goes, fear sells. A correction may be more muted and not qualify as a ""crash,"" or it may not transpire at all.

And even if a correction does take shape, it may not matter for very long. As Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Samuelson put it all the way back in 1966, ""declines in U.S. stock prices had correctly predicted nine of the last five American recessions."" In other words, there's a good chance any near-term crash will be short-lived, as the economy won't correspondingly implode with it. It's entirely possible doing nothing and riding out the volatility is prudent, too.",draftkings,"[{'neg': 0.551, 'neu': 0.449, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5994}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.0,-0.2997,0.0,-0.0999,Somewhat Negative,Neutral,Somewhat Negative,Neutral

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Conrad Grodd, vice president, investor relations.

Please go ahead, sir.

Conrad Grodd -- Vice President, Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to Roku's financial results conference call for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020.

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you for joining today's call. Q3 was remarkable for our industry and for Roku. More American consumers streamed to their TV than ever before. This included free ad-supported services as well as live programming and subscription.

The Roku Channel benefited from offering all three. Major media companies continue to reorganize around streaming. They embrace Roku because of our scale and content marketing capabilities. Partnering with Roku is an efficient way to build and retain large and valuable audiences.

Advertisers reassessed their TV upfront advertising commitments and moved significant portions of their investments to connected TV platforms like Roku. Advertising with Roku gave marketers significant incremental reach over linear TV as well as advanced capabilities to target their advertising and to measure its effectiveness. Streaming is stoking innovation and giving greater choice, value and control to consumers. Despite the ongoing uncertainty caused by the pandemic, Roku's long-term prospects are strong and our outstanding financial and operational performance in Q3 shows the inherent leverage in our business model.

With that, I'll hand it over to Steve.

Steve Louden -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Anthony. Before we take your questions, I'll walk through operational and financial highlights and discuss our viewpoint looking forward. We added 2.9 million incremental active accounts in Q3 and ended the quarter with 46 million active accounts, up 43% year over year. Sales of player units rapidly accelerated, up 57% year over year, while average selling price decreased only 1% year over year given less promotional activity due to strong demand resulting in tight inventory levels for certain products.

This extraordinary level of player unit growth was driven by a confluence of factors, including significant retailer channel inventory replenishment after strong Q2 player sales, continued robust demand for streaming players in Q3 and a portion of holiday inventory arriving at the end of Q3. Engagement on the platform continues to grow with Roku users streaming 14.8 billion hours in the quarter, up 54% year over year, and streaming hours per active account increasing at a more normalized rate of 9% year over year as COVID-related restrictions were lifted during the summer. Now I'd like to highlight a few financial items. Q3 saw record total revenues of $452 million, up 73% year over year, driven by robust growth in both the platform and player segments.

Platform segment revenue was up 78% year over year to $319 million driven by broad-based strength in both our advertising and content distribution businesses. Roku monetized video ad impressions reaccelerated to almost 90% year over year in Q3 versus roughly 50% year over year in Q2 as advertisers leaned into Roku, shifting dollars to streaming as they follow TV viewership and take advantage of increased flexibility given disruptions to the traditional TV upfront process. The content business benefited from our rapid rate of active account growth as well as strong consumer demand for ad-supported viewing, subscription services and premium movie rentals. Reflecting these factors in our content distribution deal modeled to some significant increases in the estimated lifetime deal values with an outsized portion of that value change accounted for in Q3.

As a reminder, revenue recognition for our content distribution agreements can be lumpy quarter to quarter. Player revenue grew 62% year over year, the highest growth rate in over seven years, which was driven by an extraordinary level of player unit growth, as mentioned previously. Gross profit grew faster than revenue, up 81% year over year in Q3, to $215 million. Gross margin of 47.6% increased on both a year-over-year and sequential basis driven by strong segment margins.

Platform gross margin of 61% expanded over 400 basis points versus the first half of 2020 due to margin improvements in both ads and content distribution. Player gross margin of 15% was significantly higher than the same period last year due to fewer promotions as well as lower return rates. Q3 adjusted EBITDA of $56 million was a record, eclipsing the total adjusted EBITDA in 2019 by more than 50%. This outsized level of adjusted EBITDA was the result of several positive trends combining in the quarter but also highlights the inherent leverage of the Roku business model as the platform continues to gain scale and monetization increases.

We exited the quarter with a strong cash and liquidity position, raising an incremental $148 million in equity capital via an at-the-market offering, resulting in over $1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments. We also have $69 million of available liquidity under our credit facility. Similar to last quarter, we do not intend to provide formal guidance for Q4 given that the short-term macro environment remains both variable and uncertain. We are closely tracking the potential for COVID-19 or economic-related disruptions as well as the potential impact to historical consumer spending levels or shopping patterns as we enter the holiday season.

Instead, we will provide a framework on how we believe the quarter could develop. Coming now to Q3, we are pleased with the resilience of our business and cautiously optimistic about the holiday season. Barring any significant external risk factors materializing, we estimate that the overall Q4 year-over-year revenue growth will be roughly in line with the last few holiday seasons, which was in the mid-40% range. We expect platform revenue to account for roughly two-thirds of total revenue.

As I mentioned earlier, Q3 revenue benefited from material deal value increases that we do not anticipate will be replicated in Q4. Also, this quarter, we will be lapping the anniversary of our dataxu acquisition, along with certain content distribution launches. Like past holiday seasons, we plan to keep Q4 player gross margins close to breakeven. While we anticipate Q4 platform gross margins to be between the mid-50% and 60%, which is similar to levels seen in Q2 and Q3 this year.

We anticipate the sequential growth in operating expenses from Q3 to Q4 to be in line with last year, driven primarily by headcount and sales and marketing growth. As a reminder, quarterly operating expense levels from Q1 to Q3 remained relatively consistent, in part, due to steps we took at the outset of the pandemic to slow the rate of growth of our opex. In summary, we are very pleased with the overall resiliency of our business and with our outstanding Q3 performance. Despite the macro uncertainty, we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow our business into the future and believe that pandemic has only accelerated the long-term trend toward all TV being streamed.

With that, let's turn the call over for questions. Operator?

Questions & Answers:

Operator

Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Ralph Schackart with William Blair. Your line is open.

Ralph Schackart -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Steve, just wanted to get some perspective on the Q4 guide, if I could. Obviously, mid-40% growth is great.

But just sort of looking relative to what you posted, 73% growth in Q3. Just curious if there's just added conservatism there. I'm sure there's a big element of the outsized portion of the deal that got recognized in Q3. So just any extra color there.

And if you could perhaps give some quantification or some more color on how large the outsized portion of the deal was in Q3 would be great.

Steve Louden -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. Rob, thanks for the question. Yeah. As you mentioned, I mean, Q3 was an outstanding quarter.

It's a confluence of very positive trends, record player growth. TV sales were great with our partners. And then strong performances on both the advertising and the content distribution side, including calling up on several of our deal models, the lifetime values there. In terms of Q4, I think the important thing to just focus on is there's a lot of uncertainty and variability that remains out there in the macro environment, everything from COVID-related resurgences in the U.S.

and around the world to the shape of the holiday season as well as consumer spending levels. So that's -- these are all things we're tracking, which is why we're not giving a formal outlook. So certainly, you referenced some of our color. I mean, we're very happy with the trajectory and the resilience of the business to date, and so we're cautiously optimistic on the holiday season and think it could look similar to the last couple of holiday seasons, which were in the mid-40% year-over-year growth range on a revenue basis.

As I mentioned in my remarks, we don't anticipate significant deal value changes in Q4, although that's -- obviously, we do that analysis every quarter. The other thing I'll note just that's factored into those thoughts is the fact that in Q4, we are lapping the dataxu acquisition, which came onboard mid-Q4 as well as launches of some certain new services in Q4. So those are also factors that are -- that were included in our thinking there.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Laura Martin with Needham. Your line is open.

Laura Martin -- Needham and Company -- Analyst

Great results, guys. Scott, let's start with you. I'm very interested in this sentence, the question I get the most is dataxu. Why did they buy it? And why does it matter? And I'm very interested here in these words that say, ""focused on new products like incremental reach guarantees."" Could you talk about how dataxu is giving you new products that weren't available before with this one new platform? And then for you, Anthony, you guys stay in the letter, 75% player growth year over year.

Does that imply that our mix of TV ads is now pivoted toward player -- away from the 50-50 mix toward players and our soundbars having an influence on that extra outperformance or not?

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Laura, it's Scott here. Thanks for the question. I'll talk a little bit about the context around dataxu and then provide some broader color on the newer ad products you referenced. We bought dataxu really to bring the same unique advantages we've had in the media business to a broader platform to a broader scale.

Since acquiring dataxu, we've rebranded it and relaunched it as OneView, the OneView ad platform. And we've been layering in a bunch of new features, including, for example, as you referenced, the ability to manage reach and frequency broadly across the marketers. Complete buy, so whether they're buying media from Roku or media from a publisher on Roku or media off Roku entirely, they can manage that and orchestrate that all within OneView and leverage our identity and data in -- at the same time. The incremental reach product that you're referencing is actually something we took into the upfront, and it was a -- we stepped it up.

For several years now, we've been highlighting our ability to measure reach and frequency across linear and OTT, which is a key trigger for marketers to choose to invest into OTT. This year, we stepped it up and offered guarantees in the upfront. We would guarantee that we would deliver true incremental reach over linear to marketers. So overall, tons of progress on OneView.

Significant media spend through OneView occurring in the quarter year over year, and we're really just getting going. We've got brands like DraftKings, for example, who is a big sports spender, had to shift budgets out of TV as sports was canceled and delayed, has moved a significant portion of their budget into OTT and is yet now managing most of their spend, their cross-channel spend, through OneView. That's just one example. Lexus, the national team, is really leaning into our unique capabilities, adding its on-the-home-screen sponsorable experiences and then using OneView to reach consumers off Roku for that one-two punch of a cross-platform reach.

So overall, we're very excited about progress we've made with OneView. Anthony, do you want to take the second question?

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Laura, so I think the stat you're referring to is player unit sales were up 57% year over year. Which is a great number for us. In certain international markets, like in Canada and the U.K., players unit sales actually doubled year over year.

And then Roku TVs also had an extremely strong quarter. They continue to perform very well. So we saw -- and then audio products like we just introduced, the Streambar and we have some other audio products in the market, those are still not -- still a lot smaller than player unit sales, but those are growing as well. So I think we're seeing our active account growth engines on all fronts doing really well, and the result was active accounts in the quarter were up 43% year over year to 46 million, which is great.

And we also -- I mean, we also sell lots of units that don't result in a new active account, but they result in more Rokus going into existing Roku households, which strengthens our relationship with those customers as well.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.

Michael Nathanson -- MoffettNathanson -- Analyst

Thanks. I have a couple. Whoever wants them, please do. Can you talk a bit about The Roku Channel this quarter? It looks like streaming hours slowed down a bit.

That makes sense, but Roku Channel picked up a ton of share. So what's behind that? And then I thought it was interesting that you guys announced a deal with Amazon to move Roku Channel across their platform. What does that do to perhaps to your content strategy and your partner's willingness to work with you? And do you see one day maybe moving to more original content as you build that Roku Channel further?

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Michael, this is Anthony. Yes, so The Roku Channel is doing extremely well. It's an important asset for us, and reach doubled in The Roku Channel in the quarter. But I think Scott will be best to answer most of your questions.

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yeah. It really was an incredible quarter for The Roku Channel. Active account growth now reaching active accounts with about 54 million people, double the pace of an already fast-growing underlying platform in terms of hours and reach, growing faster than any other top 10 channel. Some of this was driven, in part, by the launch of our EPG, our live channel grid, which we began rolling out in June.

It's a great product, a great way to channel surf. All this growth really accrues to Roku's benefit but also, of course, our partners who are participating and putting content into The Roku Channel. So partner earnings within The Roku Channel more than doubled in the quarter. So overall, really strong performance for The Roku Channel.

As -- in answer your question about sort of content and off platform, as The Roku Channel grows and generates even bigger and better financial outcomes for our partners, it just attracts more partners, more content, depth, more verticals. It opens up yet more possibilities for programming for us as a platform. So it's a real vehicle for us in terms of the value that it creates for our users, for Roku and for content partners participating in it. Regarding off-platform syndication of The Roku Channel, our primary focus as a company remains on our platform where we have the greatest advantages about The Roku Channel.

Our primary focus as a company remains on our platform where we have the greatest advantages, the marketing tools, the reach, data, but free, especially AVOD is a powerful recipe. And so where we see an opportunity to take The Roku Channel on to other platforms, we will explore it.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc. Your line is open.

Justin Patterson -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Great. Thank you very much. I was hoping to get a finer point on the shopper data program with Kroger. How has the uptake been with CPGs? And how many other opportunities like this, could you envision out there down the road?

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Scott, do you want to take that?

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes. Well, of course, CPG, as an advertiser category is an enormous category. And especially, I think COVID has taught us just how much consumers are willing to move their shopping online. The Kroger deal has been a very strong deal for us in terms of signaling what we're capable of given our scale and our data.

We mentioned in the shareholder letter that Snyder's, for example, saw a 250% return on ad spend. We have a bunch of brands now in and leveraging that program. And there are lots of opportunities. It is a big market.

The key for us as a platform is that first-party customer relationship and our reach into our platform with advertising. So we anticipate lots more to come on that. CPG became our fastest-growing vertical in the quarter, just as an indicator of how much potential there is.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Mr.

Helfstein, your line is open.

Jason Helfstein -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst

Thank you. So Steve, just -- can you go into a bit more detail? I mean, you called out that you had an -- you recognize an outsized portion of the content distribution lifetime value in the quarter. I think second quarter kind of also benefited, maybe you didn't call it out as much in the letter, but I recall, I think there was something in the Q about it. I mean, just help us understand kind of what those triggers are because it feels like this kind of is actually a pattern because it's a strong part of your business.

And then just with one of you, I mean, how do we think about the sizing, if we think out over the next two years? I mean, you gave some commentary in the letter with DraftKings, but I mean kind of how meaningful could that become over the next two years?

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Steve, do you want to take the first question?

Steve Louden -- Chief Financial Officer

Sure. Jason, thanks for the question. Yeah, in terms of the content distribution deal models, and this is a similar quarterly view that we -- or analysis that we do for other types of deals as well, we're in 606 accounting. We are valuing the lifetime of the deal and the content distribution deals are generally a year or two.

And so we see trends, what we're trying to better understand is whether those trends are sustainable and whether we should reflect them into the future periods. And in those cases, that can increase or decrease the overall level of the deal if they're positive or negative. In this case, in Q2, we obviously had trends that were in the early days of the pandemic in the lockdown. At that time, we didn't feel comfortable creating -- extrapolating those out too far.

But certainly, with more time, what we're seeing is a sustained acceleration in active accounts, as Anthony mentioned, driven by very strong player and TV sales as well as just very strong consumer demand for not only ad-supported viewing but also subscription services. The premium movie rental business that was pretty nascent has increased with some titles -- kind of notable titles there. And so in this case, we reassess these material deal models every quarter, but what we had was a portion of those increasing in deal values. And so that's reflected in that -- in the quarterly results because when you reflect an increase in deal value, an outsized portion of that is impacted to the current quarter.

The results can be lumpy with that. And certainly, as a reminder, that is increasing our assumptions for not only the current period but in future periods as well, which is why that can be lumpy on the quarter to quarter. So again, I think for us, I would say that, that process of looking at the deal model is definitely a quarterly part of the business, but it can go up or down. And in any given quarter, a lot of them kind of stay the same.

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Jason, let me take the second part of your question about OneView. It's a great question. Let me just -- without getting too frothy here, let me just take it in parts to highlight how big an opportunity this is for you, so -- for Roku. So on the Roku platform, we are fast growing, of course, as an ad sales team.

OneView allows us to access the yet additional, the still significant majority of impressions that are not sold by us. They're sold by publishers on our platform. It enables us to enable a marketer to use the same identity and data when buying elsewhere within the Roku ecosystem in the same way that they have been when they're buying media from Roku. But of course, as big as we are in OTT, there are other -- there's other video OTT media to be accessed outside of Roku.

So that's kind of a part two in terms of additional opportunity. And then, of course, there's omnichannel, there's desktop and mobile in tons of use cases of marketers who reach a user online and then want to retarget them in OTT, reach a user in OTT and then want to follow through on desktop and mobile. The opportunity here is really very significant for any marketer, and TV and OTT is a centerpiece in their marketing strategy. The key success factors, in our view, the right to win in our view as a platform and as a DSP really comes down, in our view, especially in this world of cookie challenges, device ID challenges is that first-party customer relationship, a platform at scale, advanced targeting and measurement, unique ad products.

These are all the things that we think make OneView strongly appealing to our clients.

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Jason, this is Anthony. Let me just add a couple of things. I would say from my point of view, the most interesting thing is that even though we have a nice robust ad business, the vast majority of advertising spend is still in linear television, it's not -- it's still not in streaming. And one of the interesting things in the quarter was the fact that advertisers are increasingly seeing streaming is something they need to start allocating a bigger portion of their budgets toward.

So it's still -- there's still a lot of opportunity because, of course, all those ads are going to switch to steaming eventually, and we think they're all going to be programmatic eventually as well through platforms like OneView.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Forte with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.

Thomas Forte -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst

Great. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask about the maturation of the AVOD market. So you talked about the changes to the upfront.

I thought that adding Roku Channel to Amazon Fire TV was a real milestone for the company. And on its earnings call, Amazon made very positive comments about the AVOD market and its own efforts. So I wanted to, in particular, talk about the maturation of AVOD, but two things in particular. What do you see as the opportunity for political ads on AVOD? And how did they perform in the quarter? And then what are your current thoughts on your international opportunity for AVOD?

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

So this is Anthony. I'll just say that AVOD is obviously a huge opportunity. We're very bullish on it. But I think Scott's best equipped to answer those questions.

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes. I mean, AVOD is vital to the OTT business model. You framed the question as maturation as though we're reaching maturation. I mean I think it's really still an extremely fast-growing and very high-potential market.

We see that in the pace of growth of The Roku Channel itself. We highlighted some stats in the shareholder letter. And I think if you look at new services coming to OTT, a majority of them are actually hybrid business models. They're subscription-based, but they're keeping the price down, and they're augmenting their revenue model through advertising.

I think also consumers have a somewhat limited budget for the number of services they're going to sign up where they're looking to save money as they leave the pay TV ecosystem. All to say, it just makes ad-supported experiences in the OTT environment that much more important. You asked about a political -- we had a strong participation in that category. Our capabilities are a key differentiator for political marketers.

But that said, it was a relatively modest contribution to an otherwise really big quarter for us in advertising. It was an important segment, a newer segment for us as a younger ad business. A great tenant to participate in, but certainly not anywhere close to a large share of our overall ad business.

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

And then on international, I can just say a few words on that. So if you just think big picture, what is our international strategy? Well, a big part of it is -- a lot of it is to replicate -- most of it actually is to replicate what we've done in the U.S. internationally. And in the U.S., we started by just focusing on building active accounts and then as we started to reach scale, layering on monetization options.

And that's what we're doing internationally as well. So we're focused primarily in this phase on building scale in the key markets. And then as we start to reach scale, we'll start to layer on monetization options. And that started, but it's still pretty nascent.

For example, The Roku Channel is available in the U.K. and it's available in Canada. But that's our overall strategy. And then I would say, thinking about AVOD, I mean, SVOD is fairly -- pay TV is popular in the United States, but in almost all international markets, AVOD is by far the dominant business model.

Free is very important worldwide.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. Your line is open.

Vasily Karasyov -- Cannonball Research -- Analyst

Thank you. So I've been hearing some concerns from investors about the press reports about Walmart selling TVs with Comcast operating system. So it does feel a little bit like the scare from last year with the Xfinity Flex. But I would appreciate your view on how this potentially can or cannot impact you.

And then I have one for Steve.

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Sure. This is Anthony. So we are the No. 1 TV OS in the United States and now in Canada, and we've achieved that position despite a very dynamic marketplace with intense competition from large tech companies and large TV companies as well.

And there's a few reasons we think we're successful or the most successful in the TV OS business. And one, of course, is just the Roku OS itself, our software. We've built a platform that's purpose-built for television. It's the best software platform for television.

It has lots of advantages for the entire ecosystem and for manufacturers, in particular. It allows them to build TVs that cost less. And so price -- it gives them a pricing advantage. So that's the big advantage, and we continue to refine that advantage.

But we do -- but so software, of course, is a big part of what we do. The other thing I would say is we have just world-class TV engineers. We have a great talent base. Those engineers come to work every day with the goal of making streaming better for our customers.

We're very focused and have a great engineering team. And then the Roku -- I would say, the Roku brand itself is a very strong brand. And for customers, it stands for streaming and great value. And so for those reasons and others, we've been very successful competing in the TV space.

It's a very competitive market. It's been competitive for a long time. But we're then No. 1 streaming OS, and I believe we're going to maintain that position.

In terms of Walmart, I'll just say a few words. I mean, Walmart is a big retailer, a very strong partner of Roku's. We have a great relationship with them. They sell millions of Roku players a year.

They sell millions of Roku TVs for various Roku OEMs, including TCL, Hisense, RCA, Philips, JVC. We build -- we help them build on branded, which is their house brand, Roku TVs, smart TVs. And that's a business that's been growing extremely well for them. So it's a great partnership, and it's a long-standing partnership, and we've put a lot of work into making sure that it stays strong.

Vasily Karasyov -- Cannonball Research -- Analyst

All right. Steve, I have a question about OneView revenue recognition. I think on the last quarter call, you said that you recognized at least the majority of it on a gross basis, and that had an impact on the margin in the quarter. And then you said that going forward, you will be recognizing an increasing proportion of it on a net basis.

So I was wondering if there was a change in impact from Q2 to Q3 from that on the margin and the platform segment.

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes. Vasily, yes, thanks for the question on that. Yes, you're right. I mean what I said was that the historical dataxu business there are effectively two parts, the kind of typical DSP business, which was net revenue treatment; and then a historical dataxu managed service business, which was on a gross revenue basis, and that as part of -- as Scott mentioned, rebranding and sort of integrating the operations to the OneView, we were shifting people over to new service agreements, and those were kind of net revenue treatment.

So that is an ongoing process. That wasn't a significant factor in the quarter. The increase -- or the expansion of the platform gross margin, both on a sequential and a year-over-year basis, was largely a result of just strong margins in both the advertising and content distribution business. So that trend will continue over time as we continue to shift more of the existing client base over to the new service agreements.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.

Steven Cahall -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Thanks. Just wanted to dive into the ad revenue a little bit. How do we think about the funnel for your ad buys between self-service, upfront deals and maybe buys through agencies that might be using their own DSPs? And I was wondering if at some point, you might look at restricting some of your high-value inventory to dataxu. And then could you give us some color as to how much your ad revenue is more like these brand marketing campaigns or upfront campaigns versus how much is more ad hoc reach extension? And how do you kind of convert somebody from a reach extension customer to something more strategic?

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Scott, do you want to take that?

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes, sure. Well, I guess, Steve, in answer to your question, we're here to sell how marketers want to buy. It's why we've got a media business and a DSP. It's why we also support third-party DSPs who want to be buying on the platform.

And it's really being able to participate in all those different ways of buying that allows us to keep expanding the segments that we serve in the ad market. We are strongest in all of those segments when a marketer comes to us and wants to take advantage of our deep first-party customer relationship, our identity, our data on users, our ability to optimize in a way that third-party ad tech cannot. And we can employ that value proposition, whether they're buying media from us, which, for example, many TV marketers do. They are IO, guaranteed Nielsen demo driven often when they first come to the platform, all the way through to programmatic buys transacted through OneView.

Our long-term view is that most TV advertising, this will take years to play out, is transacted programmatically. And referencing back to Laura Martin's question, that's why we made the move in acquiring dataxu, incorporating and relaunching OneView is so that we could enable marketers to leverage our unique assets or scale, regardless of how they're buying. So I hope that answers your question. I think maybe Steve wants to take the second part of your question on the -- more color on the revenue front.

Steve Louden -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes. It's Steve. In terms of revenue recognition, that's largely on the ad business related to when we run the ads. There can be some differences in the models themselves.

So there can be a bit of timing, but it's fairly straightforward. Was there a particular question within that?

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes. I'm sorry. Maybe I tossed it to you, Steve, and I think -- and Steve Cahall, maybe we need clarification. But I think your question was, how do they come to the platform? Is it -- are they starting from a reach extension strategy or some other case? I would say, what -- for TV marketers, their primary reason to come to Roku is the loss of reach within the linear pay TV ecosystem.

There are just -- whole classes of consumers that are simply no longer reachable through linear television ad buys. About half of TV time for adults 18 to 34 has moved to streaming. Those users are just not reachable anymore. So that's typically what brings a marketer into the Roku fold is the desire to keep reaching them on the big screen.

That said, with OneView, we have the ability, of course, to help them run an omnichannel campaign to reach a user first on the television and then retarget them off device. And we've also seen significant growth in the performance marketing, D2C segment of marketers who have social budgets. They are optimizing to a bottom-funnel outcome, a site visit an add to cart, a product purchase, a shopper data outcome. And those budgets come to us really from a different budget line at the client, and they're taking advantage of our deep data assets and ability to optimize those outcomes.

So I wouldn't call those TV dollars as much as performance marketing dollars. It's a significant growth segment for us.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet of Citi. Your line is open.

Jason Bazinet -- Citi -- Analyst

Thanks so much. The buy side is very focused on the pandemic sort of causing a big shift in streaming and digital ad dollars. And you guys referenced in your letter, some of the benefits you got as the linear TV ecosystem got gummed up with COVID. My question is, how do you think this plays out once the world goes back to normal? Do you think prudent investors should be sort of moderating their growth expectations sometimes next year? Or do you think the secular trends and all the steps you're taking will just allow you to power right through that without a deceleration?

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

This is Anthony. From my point of view, I think what we're seeing is a trend toward streaming that's been building for years now. And I think there's a lot of things that are causing it to accelerate and to continue to be a big trend, whether it's better customer value, more options, the ability to save money. There's just lots of content.

The content that's available on streaming has continued to build. And at this point, there's really nothing that you can't get by streaming. There's -- in fact, there's more content streaming than there is on traditional pay TV now. So I think the pandemic certainly helped accelerate that trend and maybe tipped over some things a little bit, but it's a trend that was happening anyway and will continue to happen for some time because everyone doesn't stream yet.

So I think we've seen strong growth. And it may moderate a little bit, but I think we're going to continue to see strong growth. I don't know. Scott, did you want to add anything to that?

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes. We're not going back to the way it was to be clear. I mean I think COVID triggered a lasting, durable change in how CMOs and marketers are thinking about their TV ad spend. We -- in Q3, we saw a 17% drop in linear viewing.

Roku was up 54%. 92% of Roku cord cutters are very satisfied with their decision to cut the cord and aren't planning to go back. So I really think this is a one-way transfer function. We don't go back to the older spending patterns because the audience isn't there.

Marketers need to follow the audience into OTT, and they stay because of the enhanced capabilities. So I think that's really what all this transition is helping teach marketers is that there's a better way. There's a more robust toolset in OTT. And we see it in our own stats, nearly 100% retention among the advertisers who spend over $1 million.

These budgets are not flowing back to television, traditional TV.

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

I mean, another proof point I got, I think, is just media companies, how they're increasingly reorganizing around streaming.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Rand with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.

Jeffrey Rand -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

Hi. Congrats on a good quarter. How are you guys thinking about advertisers' willingness to spend as the pandemic continues? And are you seeing certain industries still holding back on advertising spend?

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Scott, do you want to take that?

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes. I mean, certainly, there are some segments that are still slow to return. The ones you might expect, travel, quick-serve restaurants, things like that. But we saw a real strength in most other segments.

I mentioned CPG growing as quickly as it did. So I think that the big news here is just the shift, the realization that COVID has helped accelerate the need to reinvest in OTT. And of course, we're still early. Proportionate to viewership, we're nowhere close to capturing the kinds of budgets that are spent in television.

But the transition is very clear in the ultimate cause of the acceleration of spending in OTT.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Zgutowicz with Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open.

Mark Zgutowicz -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst

Hi, guys. Maybe a 30,000-foot and a 5,000-foot question. On the higher end, where is the measurement discussion trending in your discussions with linear buyers today? Is there any tangible measurement solutions that are on the horizon that you see more linear buyers talking about and essentially, that's loosening -- would loosen the broader bottleneck? Obviously, you're seeing nice flow in linear today, but the broader bottleneck I'm talking about. And then a little more micro.

To what extent did political or its crowding out effect on nonpolitical spend, particularly in October, have on your pricing dynamics? And where is that trending now?

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Scott, that's another one.

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes. Let me take the measurement question in parts. So one of the reasons we invested and partnered with Nielsen years ago to enable demographic measurement in our platform is so we could provide marketers with a common currency across linear and OTT. So -- and we've continued to add to that capability the ability to measure reach and demographic holistically across linear and OTT.

We launched that capability years ago. We followed that with optimization using our data to target specifically cord cutters and people who are harder to reach in linear. This year, we followed it up with the -- with a guarantee that we would not charge marketers if we reached somebody who had already been reached in linear. So I think we've been the market leader in providing TV advertisers with a common currency and frankly, a bridge from linear television into OTT.

I think the really exciting stuff happens after marketers start to invest in OTT. OTT is a native digital platform that enables measurement up and down the funnel. It is an open IAB vast-based platform. And so this enables, on any given ad, multiple simultaneous kinds of measurement.

We're not headed toward a world where there's a single currency. Sometimes when people talk about measurement challenges in OTT, I think it's because they're harkening back to a day when there was one currency. We're not headed toward a world where there's one currency. There will be many.

And OTT will be all the more stronger for it because markets of all shapes and sizes will be able to pick and choose the currency that they care most about, which best fits their tactic. And then you asked a question about political ad spend. As I mentioned earlier, it was a meaningful and a relatively new category for us. We weren't particularly active during the last congressional or presidential cycle.

And so it's an area where we've put good energy into. And I think our platform offers powerful capabilities and was very attractive to political advertisers. That said, it wasn't a huge portion of our overall business. And so I didn't have a substantial effect on like overall pricing or other dynamics.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital. Your line is open.

Mark Mahaney -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Yeah. Sorry, I came in a little late. You may have already talked about it, so you can be brief. International, just give us an update on where you are in terms of rolling out both player and platform revenue, developing both player and platform revenue in international markets.

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Mark, this is Anthony. I'd be happy to talk about international. We did touch on it briefly, but just to summarize, streaming, obviously, is a large international opportunity and phenomena, and we're making good progress. And I'll just give you some examples.

We introduced players in Brazil, for example, following up from our TV launch several months ago in Brazil, which is off to a great start. We introduced the Streambar, which is a new two-in-one product that I'm super excited about. The Streambar basically is a streaming player that also makes the app sound better on your TV. And we launched that product in the U.S., but also in U.K., Canada and Mexico.

And so in certain markets like in the U.K., player sales doubled in the quarter, which was good progress. Canada, player sales doubled. And Roku TV, it's been No. 1 for a while in the U.S.

in terms of operating systems, smart TV operating system share. It's now No. 1 in Canada, so good progress there. Then I would say the strengths that have made us successful in the United States are working as we use them in other markets as well.

If you look at our quarterly results, 43% year-over-year active account growth, which was great, I mean, I thought that was incredible, given the size of the base that we have to go on. But that active account growth came domestically, but also, there were strong international contributions to that account growth as well. Our priority is to -- like I said, it's to focus on active accounts first, build scale and then start layering on monetization. So really, that is still, in most markets, scale is still our primary focus.

We are starting to -- we've got small ad teams in some markets, testing the market. We've launched The Roku Channel in a few markets like Canada and U.K., but the monetization really will follow, and we're focusing on scale first.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Greenfield with LightShed. Your line is open.

Richard Greenfield -- LightShed -- Analyst

Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I got two. One is really a big picture for Anthony.

You've seen this wave coming for many ways -- many years and have been predicting it. The challenge right now for big media companies, a lot of your partners is that sports is not only one of the key parts of that whole ecosystem, but it's also one of the biggest drivers of advertising. And I think a lot of these big media companies are struggling to figure out an economic model for sports to shift to streaming. I guess, do you have any advice? I mean there's so much money and so many ad dollars tied to sports, and it's sort of the last thing holding up the entire multichannel bundle.

How does sports -- how do they get sports into the streaming world? Should they bundle it into existing channels? Should they have true D2C sports streaming? Like how would you advise them as they think about sports? And then I've got a follow-up on The Roku Channel.

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Sure. Well, I mean, I think -- well, first of all, you can get sports in streaming. I mean it's still part of the bundle, like you said, you have to sign up for a virtual MVPD usually. I mean there's complicated deals, multiyear, 10-year deals in sports that I'm not really an expert in.

But if I could wave my hand, I would -- sure, I think the best thing for sports would be for them to start selling SVOD services like for regional sports networks as an SVOD service or the NFL as an SVOD service. I mean that's what -- that's, I think, the way consumers want to sign up and consume sports in a streaming world. That's how they sign up and see other streaming products on à-la-carte basis.

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes. Rich, I'll just add to Anthony's point. Yes, great question, and I don't think we have a short answer for it, but just a couple of stats that you might find interesting. January to September, so sort of bridging sports going away and coming back, heavy sports fans on the Roku platform dropped their linear viewing 26% and grew their streaming 17%.

So even as sports came back, the viewership didn't come back. Among heavy NFL viewers, we saw a 29% drop in linear and a 16% increase in streaming. So the disappearance of sports during COVID kind of accelerated the pressure on that vertical in the streaming. And the viewership, and I think ultimately, the dollars are not going to come back in the same way long term.

Richard Greenfield -- LightShed -- Analyst

That's exactly what we're seeing in terms of the impact on ratings, and that's why I feel like they have to figure it out. So I appreciate that answer. The other one, Scott, you've talked before about the fact that roughly three people per -- when we look at The Roku Channel numbers you released in terms of viewers, roughly three people per household is sort of the metrics so when you try to think about it relative to your active account base. So if I look at 54 million people who watch Roku Channel or reach Roku Channel, that's like 18 million households or roughly 40% almost of your base of Roku active accounts.

What do you need to do to get that base up from 40% to 75% or 80%, let alone 100%? Like, is it purely the content? Is it awareness of The Roku Channel? Like how do you bridge that gap?

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

I think Scott can add. But --

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Go ahead, Anthony.

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

I was just going to say like that's -- getting to a big number, like 100% penetration, is obviously our goal, and that's what we've been working on from the beginning. I mean, Roku Channel started out tiny, started out with 1,000 pieces of content, very small number of users. There's this virtuous cycle where we promote it, we onboard more content, we get more users, we get more advertisers, then we get more content, we do more promotion, we get bigger titles. And so that's going -- we're just going through that virtuous cycle, and it's getting bigger and bigger as a result.

It's the fastest-growing top 10 app on the Roku platform right now. So it's -- I'm confident we can get -- we can keep growing the Roku Channel. It's still pretty small compared to where it can be.

Richard Greenfield -- LightShed -- Analyst

And when you say top 10, Anthony, is that minutes watched or times used? Or what's the best way of thinking about that metric?

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Reach and hours.

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Yes, both.

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes, yes.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

Ben Swinburne -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Thank you. Good afternoon. I want to ask Scott about social budgets and whether you think you're taking share there. Some of your peers or competitors, this earnings cycle have talked about a shift in social spend onto other platforms that are viewed as more brand-safe.

And it would seem like that could be or is and could be a huge opportunity for Roku. So I'm just wondering if that benefited the quarter something that you're focused on even further kind of differentiating your platform versus some of those massive digital budgets out there. And then I wanted to ask Steve. Just on the guidance for Q4, if I'm doing the math right, I think you're guiding to platform revenue growth in the mid-50s or so.

Is that deceleration just because you don't have the sort of 606 impact that you had in 3Q? Just looking for any color there.

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Ben, I'll take the first part of your question. Yes, I mean I do fundamentally think that we are able to compete for social budget. So we don't always know which pocket the marketer is drawing the money from. But we have heard clearly that both because of exogenous factors, pricing pressure, what's going on in the social platforms as well as like maybe, more importantly, the fact that we have the capabilities to optimize to the outcomes that these marketers are focused on.

I mean TV has just never been able to compete there. And so that's why our performance marketing segment, while still early, is growing much faster than our overall ad business. And I think, by the way, that's one of the most interesting things about OTT advertising is it isn't just going to be a branding media or performance media, it's going to be both all at the same time. There really isn't an analog in any other media out there.

Linear TV is going to remain a top-funnel branding media. Social media is very much a bottom funnel. OTT has the opportunity to be both, and it just is going to make for a very rich ecosystem as well as the opportunity to tap into very, very large budgets, not just TV, but also digital.

Ben Swinburne -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

And Scott, just to follow up quickly on performance. How are you doing attribution? Is that something that you're able to tie back to mobile cross-platform to really connect the -- close the loop for advertisers in performance?

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes, it's a mix of both first party and third party. We have a wide array of third-party attribution partners. We have our own pixel, and so marketers can pick their preferred solution in OneView. We can automatically optimize to pixel placed on an advertiser's website according to the CPA, a performance target that a marketer provides to us.

Operator

And our last question comes from --

Steve Louden -- Chief Financial Officer

Hey, Ben --

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

There was a part two on that question, right?

Operator

I am sorry.

Steve Louden -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Sorry, operator, there's a second part to Ben's question there that I want to hit. Yes, Ben, so just on Q4, so just for the good of the order, we didn't provide any formal guidance. But in terms of some of the color we gave in terms of how we're thinking about how the quarter could look barring in any of these significant external factors that could impact the short term.

What I would say about the platform revenue is, certainly, we talked about how the content distribution deal revenue recognition can be lumpy quarter to quarter. The other factors that we talked about that are platform specific was specifically lapping the dataxu acquisition, which came into the results kind of mid-Q4 of last year as well as we're lapping some launches of new services from Q4 of last year.

Operator

Thank you. And our last question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. Your line is open.

Ruplu Bhattacharya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong quarter. Just two quick ones, if I can squeeze them in. Just one on The Roku Channel again.

So you've done a great job increasing the reach of the channel. Steve, if you can just talk about how the ad load is trending on the channel. Are you happy with that load as it is today? Is there room for growth? And can you address the CPM? Do you think you can maintain the CPM? And some investors think that over time, that has to go down, but just your thoughts on that. And the second question is just on international expansion.

You've done a great job in the U.S. You've got great distribution relationships. When we look at internationally, that's a more fragmented market. So are you having to hire more people on the ground who have these relationships? And then in that vein, how should we think about opex going forward?

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

So I think the first question was actually for Scott on TRC and ad loads and CPM.

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes. I'll take that first question. We're quite happy with our recipe of half the load of linear television. We think it strikes the right balance between a great consumer experience while also providing strong monetization opportunities.

So we're not planning to tinker with that. I think there's lots of upside potential in terms of how valuable we make that inventory as well as opportunities beyond 15- and 30-second spots. We've done some work in the market with pause ads and other ad units. So I think it's a great consumer experience as delivered today.

Regarding your question about CPMs, OTT is just a better, higher-performance product. And so I think it does reasonably command higher CPMs relative to, say, linear television. That said, I don't think -- going back to the prior question, I don't think there's long-term one-single CPM to rule them all. In long run, in OTT, lots of different marketers, top to bottom of the funnel come into the ecosystem and compete in a common auction for ad inventory.

And just like you see in social media platforms, you don't end up with a singular CPM across all users and all content. That's one of the things I think is most interesting long term about the OTT media. There was a second part to the question, I think, Anthony would take it.

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. I can take the international question. So first of all, I'll just reiterate that we're making good progress internationally. And yes, it is a fragmented -- more fragmented market because -- and I would say in big part because Roku was not into those countries yet.

And so as we've entered countries and brought the full portfolio of our assets, we're gaining market share and consolidating a lot of the market around Roku. So for example, Canada, I mean, a small country, but it was the first one we went into after the U.S., and now we're No. 1 for TVs, and our player market share is very high. We have an ad sales team there.

So it's starting to look a lot like the U.S. for us. But our -- in terms of investment, international is one of our key strategic investment areas that we view. Obviously, it takes people to do it well.

The way we focus is we pick our focus countries, which we keep expanding. And then we make sure that we have local content. So we hire local people to do local content deals. We make sure we have local retailer relationships, getting into local channels, local distribution channels.

We bring Roku TV to market, which requires a lot of localization. But also in many cases, specific features that are regulated or required by the government, so we add those. We bring our players to market. We bring our audio for TV products to market, so we bring the whole portfolio of products and offer just a very complete and compelling solution.

And that's -- and then our market share starts to grow. So that's what we're doing. It's working well.

Operator

Thank you. And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Anthony Wood for any closing comments.

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, operator. I'd like to close by reiterating how pleased we are with this quarter's results and wrap up with two concluding points. First, reaching 46 million active accounts at 43% year-over-year growth rate shows Roku's momentum. It reveals Roku's scale relative to traditional pay TV providers who have continued to lose subscribers during the quarter.

The pandemic is accelerating the shift away from traditional pay TV. I'm confident that the shift to streaming will be permanent for the vast majority of consumers. Second, the strength of our financial results illustrates the leverage of our business model. The leverage of our business model may deliver over longer term as we continue to execute our strategic plan.

I hope you and your families stay safe and enjoy the upcoming holidays. Thanks again for joining the call, and happy streaming.

Operator

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Caesars Entertainment, Inc. 2020 third-quarter earnings call. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Brian Agnew, senior vice president of finance, investor relations, and treasury.

Brian Agnew -- Senior Vice President of Finance, Investor Relations, and Treasury

Well, thank you, Ashley, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Welcome to our conference call to discuss our third-quarter 2020 earnings. This afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our third-quarter financial results for the period ended September 30, 2020. The A copy of the press release is available on the investor relations section of our website at investor.caesars.com.

Joining me on the call today are Tom Reeg, our chief executive officer; Anthony Carano, our president and chief operating officer; and Bret Yunker, our chief financial officer. Before I turn the call over to Tom, I would like to remind you that during today's conference call, we may make certain forward-looking statements about the company's performance. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and, therefore, one should not place undue reliance on them. Forward-looking statements are also subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed.

For additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from those discussed in our forward-looking statements, you should refer to the cautionary statements contained in our press release, as well as the risk factors contained in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Caesars Entertainment undertakes no obligations to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after today's call. Also during today's call, the company may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed, and the reconciliation of these differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and then the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company's website at investor.caesars.com, by selecting the press release regarding the company's 2020 third-quarter financial results.

I will now turn the call over to Tom.

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everybody. We're back to report our third-quarter earnings. As you look at our income statement, keep in mind that Eldorado Resorts was the surviving entity in the transaction.

We changed our name to Caesars Entertainment. So, there's a lot of noise in the financial statements you're looking at 2019 numbers that are legacy Eldorado. You're looking at 2020 numbers that are legacy Eldorado only through July 20, and then the combined company through the end of the quarter. We're going to cut through and get you to what we think are the key points in the quarter.

Our same-store adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was a little over $460 million which was a little ahead of the wide end of the range of our pre-release during our equity offering. We're quite pleased with the progress that we've made since closing the transaction. We've seen quite a bit of opportunity within Caesars. Some was expected, some were nice surprises.

We continue to believe that we will bring the consolidated EBITDA margin in a post-COVID world at least to the mid- to high-30s, if not 40% EBITDA margin in the consolidated entity. Vegas, Anthony will get into detail, but we did $60 million of EBITDA in Vegas. And keep in mind that was with dragging Rio and Cromwell and Planet Hollywood were closed for the whole quarter. Planet Hollywood and Rio have opened since Bally's was also close for part of the quarter.

So, we are carrying operating losses relative to those assets to get to that $60 million number. Our occupancy for the quarter in Las Vegas was just under 60%, just few basis points under 60%. We're running in the mid-50s on weekdays now and weekends were well into the mid- to high-90s. So, we've been heartened by our performance.

Clearly, that's a key piece of evidence on the strength of the Caesars rewards program. Pavan Kapur at Caesars, who we inherited on the yield management side, is a wizard with this stuff and has done a tremendous job for us in Vegas, and we've moved him throughout the company in this area. So, we're excited with what Pavan and his group will bring to the table for us. As I said, the merger closed on July 20.

So, obviously, that was during the quarter. Also, we announced a cash offer to acquire William Hill during the quarter for 272p per share. That shareholder vote will take place on November 19 as is -- as needs to be the case under U.K. takeover code.

We cash confirmed the entire amount for that transaction, including an equity offering that was just shy of $2 billion on October 1 of this year. We entered -- we expanded our relationship with ESPN in the quarter on the sports betting side, which we think is an exciting piece for customer acquisition for us. We've got a co-exclusive link out across all ESPN channels with DraftKings, and we're excited with what that will bring to the table. We were also active on the asset sale front, we closed the sale -- or we announced the sale, I'm sorry, of Tropicana Evansville for 480 million to Twin River and GLPI just about a week ago.

You should expect to see more news in Indiana prior to the end of the year from us. And I would say a couple of things that I'd stress as takeaways and questions that I get. On the operating side of the business, if you annualize the costs that are out of the business this quarter, excluding gaming taxes, which obviously reduce that as gaming revenue goes down, our run rate cost reduction is about $2 billion from pre-COVID levels. There's obviously a lot of talk about what will come back, what won't come back.

A lot of those costs are never coming back, as I said. Over the last several quarters, none of that has changed. As I said, I think we're going to get to 35 to 40% EBITDA margins at a minimum. It's enjoyable from my seat to see our peers in the space reporting the same types of cost savings opportunities that we've been talking about for many years and to see Las Vegas locals margins in excess of 40% for the quarter at a couple of our peers.

That's a road map to what's coming. You think about what revenue is missing from our business. It's the highest flow-through revenue in the business. It's hotel room rate and occupancy in Las Vegas.

And what I -- I told you two quarters ago, prior to the reopenings that you were going to be surprised with what regionals could do on the margin side. And we had another quarter where if you look at our peer regionals without destination properties, EBITDA was up substantially. Anthony will get into that. What I'd tell you today is when we get into a post-COVID world, the pent-up demand you're going to see for gaming in general and Las Vegas, in particular, is going to be beyond your wildest dreams.

And the flow-through that you're going to see in the sector is unlike anything that's happened historically in this space. And so, I can't tell you when is that going to happen. I can't -- I wish I could answer when the public health situation will change. But as we look at the pieces of our database that are missing or lagging, they're the most profitable pieces of our database.

It's the 55 and over cohort that's not coming. These are people that are not going anywhere and are not spending and are going to come out of this with significant pent-up demand and spending power. And it's going to be extremely powerful what you'll see, I think, across the entertainment space, but particularly in casinos and particularly in Las Vegas. The other question I get all the time is about sports and online.

And I'd tell you, our New Jersey casino business continues to ramp up even after physical properties reopen. We're now on a run rate for $150 million of annual revenue out of the iGaming business in New Jersey at margins in the mid-30s. So, we're extremely excited about that business. We think controlling our destiny in this space positions us to be a long-term winner.

The ability to wrap our iGaming and our iCasino into a single wallet, attached to your Caesars reward database with the ability to earn and use points in any way that you'd like, online or offline. Our customers truly get an immersive experience in this company. And you see it with what we're doing in Vegas. We think that's going to translate into the online business.

And I don't really have a road map to what the ultimate size of business this will be, but I do know that if you're betting against the American people's propensity to gamble or you're betting against the lower four states to attract tax revenue when their budgets are in the place that they are today, that's been a losing bet since the dawn of civilization. So, I feel real good about where we are, where we're headed, and I'll turn it over to Anthony.

Anthony Carano -- President and Chief Operating Officer

Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. I'd like to take a few minutes to provide you with some operational highlights for our portfolio during the third quarter. Before I begin, I want to express my sincere gratitude to all of our team members for their hard work and dedication during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our operations performed extremely well during these trying times due to the outstanding service that our guests receive on a daily basis from all of our great team members.

Our success this quarter is a clear reflection of the commitment our team members who continue to work hard each day to provide a safe, healthy and exciting environment for our guests and their fellow team members. Now turning to operations. We now have 55 of our 56 properties reopened. As we mentioned in our press release, our regional properties are performing strongly.

Within our regional segment and excluding destination markets like Atlantic City, Reno, New Orleans and Tahoe, our regional properties generated a revenue decline of 11% and EBITDA growth of 10%, leading to over 700 basis points of margin expansion, 10 properties had margin growth of over 1,000 basis points. In total, and including the destination markets in our regional portfolio, regional EBITDA for the third quarter was $447 million. Now, turning to Las Vegas and our regional destination markets. Starting with Las Vegas, we now have every property open, except the Rio.

We generated $60 million of adjusted EBITDA in Las Vegas in the quarter with operating performance improving each month throughout the quarter, leading to a strong month of September. We continue to see strong occupancy trends on the weekends, in excess of 90% with mid-week occupancy still running in the 50 to 60% range. We were encouraged when Governor Sisolak lifted the meeting caps from 50 to 250 people, which has allowed us to host some small group meetings in Q4. Excluding the closed properties during the quarter, property level EBITDA was approximately $100 million.

Our destination markets in the regional portfolio displayed sequential improvement in operating performance throughout the quarter, leading to September showing the displayed sequential improvement in operating performance throughout the quarter, leading to September showing material improvement in the rate of EBITDA decline versus July and August. These regional destination properties with large hotel room portfolios are slowly recovering as operations return to normal and customers are returning to the properties. Overall, our immediate actions to reduce operating expenses at our reopened properties contributed to a leaner cost structure that we believe will contribute to sustainable EBITDA margin expansion. We are encouraged by the performance of the regional markets and the sequential rate of change in property performance within our destination markets during the quarter.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bret for some additional insights on the third quarter and details on our balance sheet and capital structure. Bret?

Bret Yunker -- Chief Financial Officer

Great. Thanks, Anthony. As everyone on the call is aware, we had quite an active third quarter even by our own standards. We closed on the Caesars merger on July 20 and subsequently announced the proposed transaction to acquire William Hill plc on September 30.

As we mentioned in the press release, our quarter ending balance sheet was impacted by the cash required to be placed in escrow for William Hill in connection with the Rule 2.7 announcement. On October 1, we completed a public equity offering of 35.6 million shares, generating net proceeds of $1.95 billion. Additionally, in early October, we entered into a GBP 1.5 billion interim facilities agreement with two large international banks. Execution of this committed debt financing allowed us to release 2 billion of cash that have been escrowed on September 30, allowing us to fully repay a 900 million draw on our parent revolver and return excess cash liquidity to our balance sheet.

As of today, both of our revolvers are undrawn, and our unrestricted cash position is over $2 billion. Based on current operating trends, we expect to end the year with a similar level of cash on hand and zero revolver balances. As I mentioned on our second-quarter call, our approach to maintenance and growth capital investment will be focused and disciplined. Over the next 12 months, we expect to spend approximately 300 to $350 million on capex, excluding any Atlantic City-specific capex that's already been escrowed.

With that, I'll turn it back to Tom.

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Bret. Let me give you -- before we go to questions, let me add a few comments on cadence of business since the quarter. Sequentially, it continues to get stronger. October was better than September.

September was better than August. If you think about what that looks like in Las Vegas, I'm going to give you some numbers that I'm not -- we're not in the habit of giving you, but given the cloudiness of business, as you look at the COVID world, I think it's useful. If you look at EBITDAR by month for us in Las Vegas, July was $10 million positive, and these are aggregate numbers, so include the losses from properties that were shut down. So, 10 in July, 16 million in August, 34 million in September, and October should push 50 million.

We've got preliminary numbers, we've not closed the month yet. So, Vegas continues to get better for us. We're not going to be talking about shutting properties midweek. Obviously, we're talking about opening additional properties.

We opened Cromwell last week. I'd expect to see Rio open before the end of the year. On the group side, the second half of '21 and beyond have record business on our books. Q2 to Q4 '21 are well ahead of our 2019 pace and bookings were strong in the third quarter, basically a normal level of bookings.

If you look at the Caesars Forum convention center, which was opened for about a day and a half before everything shut down from COVID, Caesars Forum has 172 events, 1.6 million room nights, contracted worth over $600 million in rooms and banquet revenue and 78% of that business is new to Las Vegas. And what I tell you is none of that matters if the public health situation does not improve, but we are heartened by Governor Sisolak's recent movement toward socially distance meeting business and his statement that he's looking to go to 50% capacity by the beginning of 2021. That should help us save some first half 2021 business. But first quarter, you should expect we'll look very much like the last three quarter -- the second quarter, third quarter of '20 and this quarter as well.

And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.

Questions & Answers:

Operator

[Operator instructions] And your first question comes from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel.

Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst

Hey, guys. So, Tom, I want to start in Vegas. And if you look at this point, you said your occupancies are running above 90% on the weekends, mid-50s weekdays. Is there any way to kind of think about that weekend kind of traffic, how much of that business in terms of the mid-90s is kind of a cash business versus whether that's a comp business or a reward redemption?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

So you should presume that if you look at our historical mix, Steve, that the convention business has been replaced by casino block business, and that the other segments remain relatively constant as you look back.

Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst

OK. Got you. And then, the comments you made about demand is going to be, I think you said beyond either my wildest dreams or your wildest dreams. Was that mostly related to Vegas? Is that kind of across the entire across the entire U.S.?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

It's across the entire U.S. When I tell you that our 55 and over group is significantly lagging the rest of the business that's throughout the country. And those are the people that tend to skew to older population that are not leaving their houses right now. My mother is one of those.

And when you get a vaccine and you have freedom of movement and feel better in terms of the likelihood of contracting COVID, I think that the pent-up demand for Vegas and for entertainment generally is well beyond what anyone is thinking today.

Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst

And have you seen any change in that 55 and over kind of crowd recently?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Everything is kind of grinding a little bit better every month, month over month, but it's baby steps.

Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst

OK. And then, last question. So, with William Hill, and I'm not sure how much you can say given the pending -- the deal hasn't closed yet. But let's say that deal does go through and you talked about that single app.

Do you have any idea yet in terms of when that single app would be deployed?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

I'm extremely limited in what I can speak to on William Hill outside of the four corners of the document. You can presume that we were already working in that direction in the former iteration and we would continue to work in that direction post-closing.

Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst

Great. Thanks, Tom.

Your next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.

Thomas Allen -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Hey, how are you? So it's now been about three and a half months since you bought Caesars. Can you talk a little bit about additional synergy opportunities you've found that you've kind of been under the hood for a bit longer?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. I mean, so the whole synergy discussion, as we talked about, was turned on its head by COVID. It's really a question of what comes back rather than what you subtract. But Caesars ran differently than Eldorado just from a basic day-to-day operation standpoint.

We run our properties off of daily P&Ls across every property that we own. Caesars measurement of EBITDA was far less frequent than that. And there wasn't a lot -- the operators didn't really have the tools to compare themselves across properties within the system. So when we were Eldorado as a private company and we were in two markets, we could look at those two markets and say, what are we doing well in one versus the other.

When you've got 55, that ability becomes much, much stronger. That's a benefit of scale. And Caesars was not taking advantage of that in our estimation. And you can imagine that we are -- it took us the better part of two months to get to a daily P&L, and we're still working through the kinks in the Caesars system, but we just went through our first round of quarterly reviews, and it's eye opening for the operators to see when I'm looking at each line item, each department and versus others in my market or other similar properties, things that I was unaware that I was inefficient in become obvious.

And that sort of block -- basic blocking and tackling is what we're working through now. And that's why I tell you I have an extreme level of confidence in hitting our margin targets here.

Thomas Allen -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

That's helpful. And then, just on the sports I mean iGaming, any updated thoughts around branding?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

You should expect that we will use the Caesars brand for Caesars operated -- owned and operated properties. And for third-party properties, you should expect that the William Hill brand will live on in the U.S.

Thomas Allen -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Thank you. Make sense.

Your next question comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research.

Jared Shojaian -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Tom, you talked about October Vegas pushing 50 million in EBITDA. I know there's weird seasonality with Vegas right now in the fourth quarter without the group business and the convention business.

Can you just help us think about November and December? Obviously, I know it's dependent on a lot like New Year's Eve and other holidays, but how should we think about those two months? Are you assuming that sequential step-up you've been seeing pretty consistently can continue, or is there some other factors to consider there?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

No. As you know, you're hitting a normal soft period in Vegas that November and then pre-December -- or pre-Christmas December, but what we're seeing is the reduction in volumes is not nearly what it's been historically, at least in our business. So, we feel good about posting a strong fourth quarter number in Las Vegas.

Jared Shojaian -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

OK. And then, I'll try to tackle this question a little differently. But if I think back to your most recent synergy target, the 800 million cost savings, the 100 million of revenue synergies, should we assume the entire$800 million of opportunity is already in that 2 billion number of costs that have been taken out? So really, it's entirely just a matter of getting the revenue back, or are there still some additional costs you think you could take out and then presumably, the 100 million of revenue synergies is still outstanding. Is it fair to say you really haven't gotten any of that yet?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. The revenue synergies, yes, absolutely. On the cost side, the one piece that came through COVID relatively unscathed on the Caesars side was corporate. You can see in our numbers that we cut about 200 million from -- on an annualized basis from corporate, and that's what we expected to do.

And you can see that that's complete. You should presume the rest of the cost savings are included in those numbers. But if you think about, we had an $800 million target between cost and revenue, 100 million was revenue. So, 700 million of costs, they did about 11 billion -- the combined company is about 11 billion of revenue at, let's call it, a 28% margin for 2019.

And so, if we were to get to our 35% left side of the range that I've been talking about, that's almost 800 million of just cost savings. And obviously, if we get to 40%, there is more than that.

Jared Shojaian -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

OK. Great. And maybe just to quickly follow up on that. I think you're divesting a lot more properties than you had initially expected when you announced the deal, is that positive, negative or neutral to the margin?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

It depends on the properties, I would say, of the properties that we've sold and that we're anticipating selling all of those would be -- removing them from the equation would be accretive to that overall margin target.

Jared Shojaian -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

OK. Great. Thank you very much for the time.

Your next question comes from John DeCree with Union Gaming.

John DeCree -- Union Gaming -- Analyst

Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Tom, Bret, I wanted to ask you guys a little bit about deleveraging from here and the capital that you raised this quarter earmarked for William Hill. You talked in the past about at some point, selling a strip asset just to help delever more quickly.

But based on what you see now and the amount of costs that have come out of the business and your kind of outlook for margin, how do you approach deleveraging from here? Is it going to be through EBITDA growth? I mean you have some asset sales that you just talked about will help. But just curious to get your thoughts on the cadence over the next 12 or 18 months, ways that you'll work down leverage.

Bret Yunker -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, it's really going to be a combination of all of the above. Again, we're hopeful that we're nearing an inflection point here where we start generating strong free cash flow post this health crisis. So, that's obviously No. 1.

Alongside that, we've been announcing asset sales, and we expect to continue announcing them going forward. So, that will be part of the package. And Las Vegas, we want to get past the health crisis and then think about monetizing an asset here. So, all three of those alongside the denominator growing sequentially is going to help us deleverage in the next 12 to 24 months.

John DeCree -- Union Gaming -- Analyst

And Tom, on the sports and iCasino strategy, assuming the transaction with William Hill proceeds, and you look at your portfolio of brands and assets, do you see any need or opportunity to add additional, either services or brands or partners for that portfolio? You've got a big one with ESPN. Is there still more to do as you continue to build out business?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

This is all about building market share profitably and making your customers as sticky as possible. And so, we think we have the building blocks to do that with what we'll have post the William Hill transaction, but we'll always be looking to improve upon that. And I've found it interesting to see non-gaming entities look into this space, just the IAC moving into MGM, obviously, what ESPN did with us and DraftKings. Obviously, there are a lot of companies out there who are looking for share of wallet and screen time on your phone.

So, it wouldn't surprise me if you see more of that as we move into the future. And If there were a partnership or a transaction that would improve our position then we could execute it in a manner that was -- that created additional value for our stakeholders, we would certainly take a serious look.

John DeCree -- Union Gaming -- Analyst

Very good. Thanks for the questions guys.

Your next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie.

Chad Beynon -- Macquarie Research -- Analyst

Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question, guys. I wanted to drill into the regional gaming EBITDA 444 million or, I guess, maybe more importantly, the 33% margin. You noted that it was hamstrung by some of these regional, I guess, destination properties and Lake Charles being closed. I was wondering if you are willing to, I guess, help us think about what the drag was, or if these properties had been punching at the same level as the other assets, what the result would have been? Any more color just on kind of the impact there and how to think about that going forward?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

So you've got New Jersey, Reno and New Orleans that are your biggest drags, obviously, like Charles this quarter, given the storm. But in the -- in terms of materiality, the three are in Atlantic City, Reno, New Orleans. Atlantic City opened very beginning of the quarter. You had no alcohol service, you had no food service and significant limitations on capacity that lasted for a significant period of time during your peak season in Atlantic City.

So, Atlantic City comps obviously look poor. In Reno, we had the Silver Legacy tower open. We had a fair amount of Eldorado rooms open. We did not have the Circus Circus 1,600 rooms opened at all, again, in the seasonal peak for the market.

And then New Orleans, New Orleans is a significant national database receiver of business. People not traveling New Orleans as a market as their restrictions are stricter than the state itself. You have legislative-mandated labor count in New Orleans and you have a tax system where we paid a fixed rate in the quarter versus the variable rate that we typically pay. So those three properties are significant drags as we move into fourth quarter and you get into the shoulder season, Reno and Atlantic City look a lot better because you're doing pretty well on a comp basis midweek in those markets when properties weren't full this time last year and the weekend drop-off is not nearly what it was in the summer.

New Orleans still has all of the same issues that it had in the third quarter.

Chad Beynon -- Macquarie Research -- Analyst

Great. Really helpful. And then, Bret, just on the cash flow side, could you just remind us in terms of what the annual or quarterly cash interest and cash rent will be? A little bit of noise in the reporting here, but that would be helpful.

Bret Yunker -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, putting GAAP aside, on a pure cash basis, we're roughly $2 billion all-in of annual master lease, rent payments and interest expense, so you can just divide that by four for the quarters.

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

About 1.2 billion of rent and 800 million of interest.

Chad Beynon -- Macquarie Research -- Analyst

Thank you, guys.

Your next question comes from Dan Politzer with JP Morgan.

Dan Politzer -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst

Afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping that you could give maybe an update on your iGaming rollout and when we could expect to see your launch in Pennsylvania, more formally at least? And maybe if there's any plans for Michigan and if you have a market access agreement there?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, on Michigan, an intention to roll out there, Pennsylvania, I don't know --

Anthony Carano -- President and Chief Operating Officer

Yeah. We're live in Pennsylvania, Dan, right now. We're rolling out more product and more games as every day and week passes. So, we're expecting to see incremental opportunities in 2021 as these new products are rolled out.

So, we would be optimistic on growth in Pennsylvania in 2021. Also in the state of New Jersey, we're going to be launching live dealer on the Caesars side for iGaming. So, that's an exciting opportunity as well.

Dan Politzer -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst

Got it. And then, in Virginia, there was recently passed legislation that legalized gaming in Danville, where you talked about building a casino. Could you maybe talk to us about -- a little bit about the project, potential cost and return, the competitive environment there and how you're thinking about this at a high level?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. So, the project that was approved, we'd expect 20% returns on roughly a $400 million investment. Keep in mind, as you look at that project, that's in the radius of the Cherokee property that we operate in North Carolina and the Tribe has the opportunity and the option to opt in up to 80% of the equity of the Danville property, and that became available to them upon the passage of the vote on Tuesday. So, it's too early to say where that will eventually head.

Dan Politzer -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst

Got it. Thanks so much guys. Appreciate it.

Your next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies.

David Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Hi. Afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the WH acquisition and essentially why now and the degree to which you get close on it, what kind of tech investment and/or marketing spend you envision might be required to be a leader with it or could be successful with it?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. So, as we looked at the opportunity in the space, as I've said, I think this is the most significant growth opportunity in the casino space since riverboats were legalized in the '90s. We were looking at the partnership that we brought in from the Eldorado side where if you recall, we entered that partnership knowing that Eldorado's brand was unlikely to play on a national basis. We wanted to form a partnership with a respected sports betting operator that had a national strategy where we could participate in the upside.

We subsequently bought Caesars who obviously has a very different brand situation than Eldorado, and it became clear that we have a brand that can resonate on a national level. We've got a database that can feed into that business. And we had been talking about how should we proceed with the partnership. If you recall, the partnership included sports betting and not -- include sports betting and not Internet casino.

If you're going to get to a single wallet solution, you need both. So, it really wasn't ideal for either partner in the current landscape. So, as we looked at potential solutions, it became clear to us that the best answer for us was to control our own destiny here. And so, we started discussions about a purchase and ended up where you saw us end up.

On the marketing question, yes, the combined company here, the combined pro forma entity, iGaming and sports, does about $100 million -- will do about $100 million in EBITDA, positive EBITDA, not the 200, 300 million of negative EBITDA that you're accustomed to in the space, it will do $100 million of positive EBITDA. That includes all of the marketing that we're doing now. So, if you see us ramp up marketing, it's from an EBITDA positive position. In terms of the tech spend, William Hill has been spending a significant amount of capital developing its Liberty platform that rolled out in New Jersey to strong reviews.

They're in the process of continuing to roll that out throughout the U.S. You're never going to stop spending on tech, but I don't see a significant material tech spend that's -- you should be plugging into your model that's going to be a giant sort of cash. You should be thinking of 10, $20 million a year neighborhood.

David Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst

OK. And I recall, I hope I have your terminology correct, but the notion that iGaming and sports betting may warrant its own brain at some point. How have you thought about making sure that that business can grow and achieve what it needs to achieve under your roof versus its own roof?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

So it will be an unrestricted sub of Caesars Entertainment upon closing. Post the Caesars acquisition, Eric Hession and Chris Holdren, out of the Caesars side, agreed to stay as co-Presidents of that business for us. Christian Stuart, on the operations side, has been invaluable in this process for us, will remain involved. So you will see it as it will operate as a subsidiary of its own, you will be able to see the numbers of it on its own, then the question becomes what's the best structure from a capital markets perspective.

And we have time to make those decisions. The expectation at the outset is it will be a wholly owned unrestricted sub of Caesars Entertainment, will not have its own currency. But as you know, we are 100% focused on driving value to our shareholders. And if the right answer is it becomes a separate entity with its own currency, you might see us head in that direction in the future.

David Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Great. Thank you so much.

Your next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist Securities.

Barry Jonas -- Truist Securities -- Analyst

Hey, guys. I wanted to start with Vegas. Can you maybe just talk about the reintroduction of entertainment? How profitable do you think that can be either directly or indirectly? And then also, what's been the response so far to the return of paid parking?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. So, on the question of entertainment, we're absolutely thrilled that we've seen movement in that area and the ability to operate what our some fairly small venue entertainment across the city, what you're seeing come back, you're not seeing headline entertainment come back. You're not seeing big production shows come back. What you're seeing are the 500, 600 seats that are now offering 100, 200 seats.

It's not a hugely profitable business on its own, but it creates additional reason to visit the market, and that's important to us. Every piece that we get that becomes another reason for someone to make the move to either drive here or fly here and stay in the market is good for the whole market. So, we're extremely pleased that we're able to offer entertainment today. The initial response has been extremely strong, and we're happy to have it back.

Now, the issue of parking, you got a heavy drive-in business now. As I said, we're mid-90 to high 90s occupancy on the weekends as you -- and you know that we have kind of 50-yard line real estate on the strip. So, what we were finding was our best customers were having difficulty finding parking in our garages even if they had a lodging reservation. And so, what we wanted to do was to bring back parking -- to bring back parking fees as kind of a hurdle so that our best customers can get to the property.

If you are a significant Caesars reward customer, you're a lodger or you're a local, you're not paying for parking. And to drive home the point that this was for those purposes and because of the situation that we've seen in Nevada, as we implemented, we said we're going to donate all of our profits from parking for this quarter and next to local charities that support the community and those that have been displaced by COVID. So, the response has been overwhelmingly positive from the city and from our customers.

Barry Jonas -- Truist Securities -- Analyst

That's great. And then, just a follow-up. How are you thinking about, I guess, OpCo mix to the business now? Tom, in the past, you've talked about sort of like a 50-50 mix. Is that still the goal once the dust settles?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. You shouldn't see us doing sale-leaseback transactions of -- or sales of real estate that will skew that. As you've seen us in the past, we've utilized the prop co market for financing typically for transactions. So, were there something to come up that made sense, it could be a tool that's used, but I don't expect us to be particularly acquisitive from here, so you shouldn't see much movement on the real estate side.

Barry Jonas -- Truist Securities -- Analyst

Great. Thanks so much.

Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.

Shaun Kelley -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Two questions. Just wanted to go back to the sort of regional margin performance. If we look at the kind of the numbers on a quarter basis, talking about those 700 basis points, is it fair just as we think about continued recognition of some of the synergies in some of your initiatives that 700 basis points could actually improve or accelerate from here, or do you think this is a good reflection of what the ability of the business can be when everything else starts to settle in?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

You should expect that it can continue to grow because, as I talked about earlier, what's missing from the business is some of your highest flow-through revenue. So, as that starts to come back into these markets, and I'm thinking particularly of Atlantic City, Reno and New Orleans, flow-through is quite high. And their contribution to the total regional pie in a post-COVID world should drive the entire regional sector margin higher.

Shaun Kelley -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

That's really helpful, Tom. And then, sort of a separate but big picture strategic question. So, there's been some discussion as it relates to William Hill and I guess the bigger kind of picture strategy here as it relates to this kind of single wallet or access to the customer probably via an app. And I'm just kind of curious like Caesars always took a pretty centralized or increasingly moved to a centralized marketing approach.

Tom, at Eldorado, I think without mischaracterizing, you guys were always pretty focused on a decentralized approach to really accessing the customers, empowering some of the local property managers. How do you think about that in the digital realm? So just sort of how do you kind of like connect all this together as it relates to software and one vision of the customer? Does it sort of need to be centralized, or can you balance those two approaches? And how would you sort of go about doing it, or does anything need to change?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

I think you should think about it as to how we operate the entire business. What will differentiate us in this space is the stickiness of our customers, the immersion in our network. If you think about -- I know you're -- in the free COVID world, you'd be a frequent traveler like I was. Think of the gymnastics you would go through to make sure that you're flying on your favorite airline or you're staying in your hotel where you've got the most points.

That's what we've got in the Caesars rewards system, and it's a much broader relationship than just how much money did I give you to place your sports bet on my app. It's a much stickier customer. So, you shouldn't think of the sports betting marketing is going to be materially different than the way that we built the business on the bricks-and-mortar side. I understand there's this race for market share and handle and all the numbers that come out monthly right now.

This is a long game. I go back to my riverboat example. I remember calling on names like Casino Magic and Casino America and Players International Argosy Gaming, all of those ultimately went away and got consolidated into the leaders in the business. That's where we're going to end up.

You are in inning one of if you're thinking in baseball terms, what ultimately will be an extra inning game. And we're assembling the building blocks to be a winner here long term to attract as much market share as we can over time profitably, but make sure that it's sticky. I can make my market share in any individual market, look the way that I wanted to look to report to you at the end of the month if I throw enough money at it. That's not how we do business.

That's not how you should expect us to tackle this area.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Caesars Entertainment Inc. 2020 Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Brian Agnew, Senior Vice President of Finance, Investor Relations and Treasury.

Brian Agnew -- Investor Relations

Well, thank you, Ashley, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Welcome to our conference call to discuss our third quarter 2020 earnings. This afternoon we issued a press release announcing our third quarter financial results for the period ended September 30, 2020. A copy of the press release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.caesars.com.

Joining me on the call today are Tom Reeg, our Chief Executive Officer; Anthony Carano, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bret Yunker, our Chief Financial Officer.

Before I turn the call over to Tom, I would like to remind you that during today's conference call we may make certain forward-looking statements about the company's performance. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and therefore one should not place undue reliance on them. Forward-looking statements are also subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed. For additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from those discussed in our forward-looking statements, you should refer to the cautionary statements contained in our press release as well as the risk factors contained in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Caesars Entertainment undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after today's call.

Also, during today's call, the company may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of these differences between these non-GAAP financial measure and in the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company's website at investor.caesars.com by selecting the Press Release regarding the company's 2020 third quarter financial results.

I will now turn the call over to Tom.

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon everybody. We're back to report our third quarter earnings. As you look at our income statement, keep in mind that Eldorado Resorts was the surviving entity in the transaction, we changed our name to Caesars Entertainment. So there is a lot of noise in the financial statements you're looking at 2019 numbers that our Legacy Eldorado, you are looking at 2020 numbers that are Legacy Eldorado only through July 20 and then the combined company through the end of the quarter. We're going to cut through and get you to what we think are the key points in the quarter.

Our same-store adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was a little over $460 million, which was a little ahead of the wide end of the range of our pre-release during our equity offering. We're quite pleased with the progress that we've made since closing the transaction. We've seen quite a bit of opportunity within Caesars, some was expected, some were, were nice surprises, we continue to believe that we will bring the consolidated EBITDA margin in a post-COVID world at least to the mid to high 30s, if not 40% EBITDA margin in the consolidated entity.

Vegas, Anthony will get into detail, but we did $60 million of EBITDA in Vegas and keep in mind that was dragging Rio and Cromwell and Planet Hollywood were closed for the whole quarter. Planet Hollywood and Rio have opened since Bally's was also closed for part of the quarter. So we are carrying operating losses relative to those assets to get to that $60 million number. Our occupancy for the quarter in Las Vegas was just under 60% just a few basis points under 60%. We're running in the mid 50s on week days now and weekends we're well into the mid to high 90s. So we've been heartened by our performance, clearly that's a key piece of evidence on the strength of the Caesars Rewards program having to pour Caesars who we inherited on the yield management side is a wizard with this stuff and has done a tremendous job for us in Vegas and we've moved him throughout the company in this area. So we're excited with what Pavan and his group will bring to the table for us.

As I said the merger closed on July 20. So obviously that was during the quarter. Also we announced an acquisition -- cash offer to acquire William Hill during the quarter for 272 pence per share, that shareholder vote will take place on November 19 as is the case -- as needs to be the case under UK takeover code, we cash confirmed the entire amount for that transaction, including an equity offering, that was just shy of $2 billion on October 1 of this year. We entered -- we expanded our relationship with ESPN in the quarter, on the sports betting side, which we think is an exciting piece per customer acquisition for us. We've got a co-exclusive link out across all ESPN channels with DraftKings and we're excited with what that will bring to the table.

We were also active on the asset sale front, we closed the sale or we announced the sale, I'm sorry of Tropicana Evansville for $480 million to Twin River and GLPI just about a week ago. You should expect to see more news in Indiana, prior to the end of the year from us. And I would say, a couple of things that I stress as takeaways and questions that I get on the operating side of the business, if you annualize the costs that are out of the business this quarter, excluding gaming taxes which obviously reduce as gaming revenue goes down. Our run rate cost reduction is about $2 billion from pre-COVID levels. There's obviously a lot of talk about what will come back, what won't come back. A lot of those costs are never coming back. As I've said, over the last several quarters none of that has changed. As I've said, I think we're going to get to 35% to 40% EBITDA margins at a minimum, its enjoyable from my seat to see our peers in this space reporting the same types of cost savings opportunities that we've been talking about for many years and to see Las Vegas locals margins in excess of 40% for the quarter and a couple of our peers, that's a roadmap to what's coming.

You think about what revenue is missing from our business? It's the highest flow through revenue in the business, it's hotel room rates and occupancy in Las Vegas. And what I told you two quarters ago, prior to the reopening is that you were going to be surprised with what regionals could do on the margin side and we had another quarter where if you look at our peer regionals without destination properties, EBITDA was up substantially as we will get into that.

What I tell you today is when we get into a post-COVID world, the pent-up demand you're going to see for gaming in general and Las Vegas in particular is going to be beyond your wildest dreams. You're -- and the flow-through that you're going to see in the sector is unlike anything that's happened historically in this space. And so I can't tell you when is that going to happen, I can't -- I wish I could answer when the public health situation will change, but as we look at the pieces of our database that are missing or lagging, they are the most profitable pieces of our database, its the 55 and over cohort that's not coming. These are people that are not going anywhere, and are not spending, and are going to come out of this with significant pent-up demand and spending power and it's going to be extremely powerful what you'll see, I think across the entertainment space, but particularly in casinos in particularly in Las Vegas.

The other question I get all the time is about sports and online and I'd tell you our New Jersey Casino business continues to ramp up even after physical properties reopened, we're now on a run rate for $150 million of annual revenue out of the iGaming business in New Jersey at margins in the mid 30s. So we're extremely excited about that business. We think controlling our destiny in this space, positions us to be a long-term winner, that the ability to rap our iGaming in our iCasino into a single wallet attached to your Caesars Reward database with the ability to earn and use points in any way that you'd like online or offline.

Our customers truly get an immersive experience in this company, and you see it with what we're doing in Vegas, we think that's going to translate into the online business and I don't really have a roadmap to what the ultimate size of this business will be, but I do know that if you're betting against the American people's propensity to gamble or you are betting against the lower four states to attract tax revenue when their budgets are in the place that they are today, that's been a losing bet since the dawn of civilization. So I feel real good about where we are, where we're headed.

And I'll turn it over to Anthony.

Anthony Carano -- President and Chief Operating Officer

Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. I'd like to take a few minutes to provide you with some operational highlights for our portfolio during the third quarter. Before I begin, I want to express my sincere gratitude to all of our team members for their hard work and dedication during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our operations performed extremely well during these trying times, due to the outstanding service that our guests receive on a daily basis from all of our great team members. Our success this quarter is a clear reflection of the commitment our team members who continue to work hard each day to provide a safe, healthy and exciting environment for our guests and their fellow team members.

Now turning to operations. We now have 55 of our 56 properties reopened. As we mentioned in our press release, our regional properties are performing strongly. Within our regional segment and excluding destination markets like Atlantic City, Reno, New Orleans and Tahoe, our regional properties generated a revenue decline of 11% and EBITDA growth of 10%, leading to over 700 basis points of margin expansion. 10 properties had margin growth of over 1,000 basis points. In total and including the destination markets in our regional portfolio, regional EBITDA for the third quarter was $447 million.

Now turning to Las Vegas in our regional destination markets. Starting with Las Vegas, we now have every property open except the Rio. We generated $60 million of adjusted EBITDA in Las Vegas in the quarter with operating performance improving each month throughout the quarter, leading to a strong month of September. We continue to see strong occupancy trends on the weekends in excess of 90% with mid-week occupancies still running in the 50% to 60% range. We were encouraged with when Governor Sisolak lifted the meeting caps from 50 to 250 people, which has allowed us to host some small group meetings in Q4. Excluding the closed properties during the quarter, property level EBITDA was approximately $100 million.

Our destination markets in the regional portfolio displayed sequential improvement in operating performance throughout the quarter, leading to September, showing the displayed sequential improvement in operating performance throughout the quarter, leading to September showing material improvement in the rate of EBITDA decline versus July and August. These regional destination properties with large hotel room portfolios are slowly recovering as operations return to normal and customers are returning to the office. Overall, our immediate actions to reduce operating expenses and to reopen properties contributed to a leaner cost structure that we believe will contribute to sustainable EBITDA margin expansion. We are encouraged by the performance of the regional markets and the sequential rate of change in property performance within our destination markets during the quarter.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bret for some additional insights on the third quarter and details on our balance sheet and capital structure. Bret?

Bret Yunker -- Chief Financial Officer

Great, thanks Anthony. As everyone on the call is aware we had quite an active third quarter even by our own standards. We closed on the Caesars merger on July 20 and subsequently announced the proposed transaction to acquire William Hill PLC on September 30. As we mentioned in the press release, our quarter ending balance sheet was impacted by the cash required to be placed in the escrow for William Hill in connection with the Rule 2.7 announcement.

On October 1, we completed a public equity offering of 35.6 million shares generating net proceeds of $1.95 billion. Additionally, in early October, we entered into a GBP1.5 billion interim facilities agreement with two large international banks. Execution of this committed debt financing allowed us to release $2 billion of cash that have been escrowed on September 30, allowing us to fully repay a $900 million draw on our parent revolver and return excess cash liquidity to our balance sheet. As of today, both of our revolvers are undrawn and our unrestricted cash position is over $2 billion. Based on current operating trends, we expect to end the year with a similar level of cash on hand and zero revolver balances.

As I mentioned on our second quarter call, our approach to maintenance and growth capital investment will be focused and disciplined. Over the next 12 months we expect to spend approximately $300 million to $350 million on capex, excluding any Atlantic City specific capex that's already been escrowed.

With that I will turn it back to Tom.

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Bret. Let me give you -- before we go to questions, let me add a few comments on cadence of the business. Since the quarter sequentially, it continues to get stronger. October was better than September, September was better than August. If you think about what that looks like in Las Vegas, I'm going to give you some numbers that I'm not -- we're not in the habit of giving you, but given the cloudiness of business as you look at the COVID world, I think it's useful.

If you look at EBITDAR by month for us in Las Vegas, July was $10 million positive and these are aggregate numbers, so include the losses from properties that were shut down. So a $10 million in July, $16 million in August, $34 million in September and October should push $50 million. We've got preliminary numbers, we've not closed the month yet. So Vegas continues to get better for us. We are not going to be talking about shutting properties mid week, obviously we're talking about opening additional properties. We opened Cromwell last week. I'd expect to see Rio open before the end of the year.

On the Group side. The second half of '21 and beyond, have record business on our books. Q2 to Q4 '21 are well ahead of our 2019 pace and bookings were strong in the third quarter basically, at normal level of bookings. If you look at the Caesars Forum Convention Center which was opened for about a day and a half before everything shutdown from COVID, Caesars Forum has a 172 events, 1.6 million room nights contracted worth over $600 million in rooms and banquet revenue and 78% of that business is new to Las Vegas. And when I tell you is none of that matters if the public health situation does not improve, but we are heartened by Governor Sisolak's recent movement toward socially distance meeting business and his statement that he is looking to go to 50% capacity by the beginning of 2021. That should help us save some first half 2021 business, but first quarter you should expect we will look very much like the last three quarters -- the second quarter, third quarter of '20 and this quarter as well.

And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel.

Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel -- Analyst

Hey, good afternoon guys. So, Tom, I want to start in Vegas, and if you look at this point, you said your occupancies are running above 90% on the weekends, mid 50s weekdays. Is there anyway to kind of think about that we can kind of traffic, how much of that business in terms of the mid 90s is kind of a cash business versus whether that's a comp business or reward redemption?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

So you should presume that if you look at our historical mix, Steve, that the convention business has been replaced by Casino Block business and that the other segments remained relatively constant as you look back.

Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel -- Analyst

Okay, got you. And then the comments you made about demand is going to be, I think you said beyond either my wildest dreams or your wildest dreams, was that mostly related to Vegas, was that kind of across the entire US?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

It's across the entire US. When I tell you that our 55 and over Group is significantly lagging the rest of the business that's throughout the country. And those are the people that tend to skew to older population that are not leaving their houses right now. My mother is one of those. And when you get a vaccine and you have freedom of movement and feel better in terms of the likelihood of contracting COVID, I think that the pent-up demand for Vegas and for entertainment generally is well beyond what anyone is thinking today.

Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel -- Analyst

And have you seen any change in that 55 and over kind of crowd recently?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

It's everything is kind of grinding a little bit better every month, month-over-months. But it's baby steps.

Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel -- Analyst

Okay. And the last question, so with William Hill, and I don't -- I'm not sure how much you can say given the pending, the deal hasn't closed yet, but let's say that deal does go through and you talked about that single app. Do you have any idea yet in terms of when that single app would be deployed?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

I am extremely limited in what I can speak to on William Hill outside of the corner -- four corners of the document. You can presume that we were already working in that direction, in the former iteration and we would continue to work in that direction, post closing.

Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel -- Analyst

Okay, great. Thanks, Tom.

Operator

Your next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.

Thomas Allen -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Hey, how are you? So, it's now been about 3.5 months since you bought Caesars. Can you talk a little bit about additional synergy opportunities you've found that you've kind of been under the hood for a bit longer? Thanks.

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

I mean, so the whole synergy discussion as we've talked about was turned on its head by COVID. It's really a question of what comes back rather than what do you subtract, but Caesars ran differently than Eldorado, just from a basic day-to-day operation standpoint. We run our properties off of daily P&Ls across every property that we own. Caesars measurement of EBITDA was far less frequent than that. And there wasn't a lot -- the operators, didn't really have the tools to compare themselves across properties within the system.

So when we were Eldorado as a private company and we were in two markets, we could look at those two markets and say what are we doing well in one versus the other when you've got 55 that ability becomes much, much stronger, that's a benefit of scale, and Caesars was not taking advantage of that in our estimation. And you can imagine that we are -- it took us the better part of two months to get to a daily P&L and we're still working through the kinks in the Caesars system, but we just went through our first round of quarterly reviews and its eye opening for the operators to see when I'm looking at each line item, each department and versus others in my market or other similar properties, things that I was unaware that I was inefficient in become obvious and that sort of basic blocking and tackling is what we're working through now and that's why I tell you, I have an extreme level of confidence in hitting our margin targets here.

Thomas Allen -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

That's helpful, thanks. And then just on the sports I mean iGaming. Any updated thoughts around branding?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

You should expect that we will use the Caesars brand for Caesars operated, owned and operated properties. And for third-party properties, you should expect that the William Hill brand will live on in the US.

Thomas Allen -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Helpful. Thank you.

Operator

Your next question comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research.

Jared Shojaian -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Hi, good afternoon everyone and thanks for taking my question. Tom, you talked about October Vegas pushing $50 million in EBITDAR. I know there is weird seasonality with Vegas right now in the fourth quarter without the Group business and the convention business. Can you just help us think about November and December? Obviously, I know it's dependent on a lot like New Year's Eve and other holidays, but how should we think about those two months? Are you assuming that sequential step up, you've been seeing pretty consistently can continue or is there some other factors to consider there?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Jared you know you're hitting a normal soft period in Vegas that November and then pre-December, pre-Christmas December, but what we're seeing is the reduction in volumes is not nearly what it's been historically at least in our business. So we feel good about posting a strong fourth quarter number in Las Vegas.

Jared Shojaian -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Okay, thank you. And then, I'll try to tackle this question a little differently, but if I think back to your most recent synergy target that $800 million cost savings, $100 million of revenue synergies. Should we assume the entire $800 million of opportunity is already in that $2 billion number of costs that have been taken out. So really it's entirely just a matter of getting the revenue back? Or are there still some additional cost you think you could take out and then presumably the $100 million of revenue synergies is still outstanding? Is it fair to say you really haven't got any of that yet?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes, on the revenue synergies, yes, absolutely. On the cost side, the one piece that came through COVID relatively unscathed on the Caesars side was corporate. You can see in our numbers that we cut about $200 million from -- on an annualized basis from corporate and that's what we expected to do and you can see that that's complete. You should presume the rest of the cost savings are included in those numbers. But if you think about, we had an $800 million target between costs and revenue, $100 was revenue, so $700 million of costs, they did about $11 billion -- the combined companies about $11 billion of revenue and let's call it, a 28% margin for 2019. So if we were to get to our 35% left side of the range that I've been talking about, that's almost $800 million of just cost savings. And obviously, if we get to 40%, there is more than that.

Jared Shojaian -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Okay, great. Maybe just to quickly follow-up on that, I think you're divesting a lot more properties than you had initially expected when you announced the deal. Is that positive, negative or neutral to the margin?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

It depends on the properties. I would say, of the properties that we've sold and that we're anticipating selling all of those would be removing them from the equation would be accretive to that overall margin target.

Jared Shojaian -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Okay, great. Thank you very much for the time.

Operator

Your next question comes from John DeCree with Union Gaming.

John DeCree -- Union Gaming -- Analyst

Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Tom, Bret, I wanted to ask you guys a little bit about deleveraging from here and the capital that you've raised this quarter earmarked for William Hill, you've talked in the past about at some point selling a strip asset just to help delever more quickly. But based on what you see now, and the amount of costs that have come out of the business in your kind of outlook for margin, how do you approach deleveraging from here? Is it going to be through EBITDA growth, I mean you have some asset sales that you just talked about, that will help, but just curious to get your thoughts on the cadence over the next 12 or 18 months, ways that you're working on leverage?

Bret Yunker -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes, it's really going to be a combination of all of the above. Again, we're hopeful that we're nearing an inflection point here where we start generating strong free cash flow post this health crisis. So that's obviously number one. Alongside that we've been announcing asset sales and we expect to continue announcing them going forward. So that'll be part of the package and Las Vegas, we want to get past the health crisis and then think about monetizing an asset here. So all three of those alongside the denominator growing sequentially is going to help us deleverage over the next 12 to 24 months.

John DeCree -- Union Gaming -- Analyst

Thanks, Bret. And Tom on the sports and iCasino strategy, assuming the transaction with William Hill proceeds and you look at your portfolio of brands and assets. Do you see any need or opportunity to add additional services or brands or partners for that portfolio? You've got a big one with ESPN. Are there -- is there still more to do as you continue to build that business?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

This is all about building market share profitably and making your customers as sticky as possible. And so we think we have the building blocks to do that with what will have post the William Hill transaction, but we'll always be looking to improve upon that. And I found it interesting to see non-gaming entities look into this space. Just the IAC moving into MGM, obviously what ESPN did with us and DraftKings, obviously there are a lot of companies out there who are looking for share of wallet and screen-time on your phone. So wouldn't surprise me if you see more of that as we move into the future. And if there were a partnership or a transaction that would improve our position, and we could execute it in a manner that was -- that created additional value for our stakeholders, we would certainly take a serious look.

John DeCree -- Union Gaming -- Analyst

Very good. Thanks for the questions, guys.

Operator

Your next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie.

Chad Beynon -- Macquarie -- Analyst

Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question guys. Wanted to drill into the regional gaming EBITDA $444 million or I guess maybe more importantly the 33% margin. You noted that it was hamstrung by some of these regional I guess destination properties and in Lake Charles being closed. I was wondering if you're willing to, I guess, to help us think about what the drag was or if these properties had been punching at the same level as the other assets what the result would have been? Any more color just on kind of the impact there and how to think about that going forward? Thanks.

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

So you've got New Jersey, Reno and New Orleans that are your biggest drags, obviously Lake Charles this quarter given the storm, but in the -- in terms of materiality the three are Atlantic City, Reno, New Orleans. Atlantic City opened very beginning of the quarter. You had no alcohol service, you had no foodservice and significant limitations on capacity that lasted for the significant period of time during your peak season in Atlantic City. So Atlantic City comps obviously look poor. In Reno, we had the Silver Legacy Tower opened, we had a fair amount of Eldorado rooms open. We did not have the Circuit Circa -- Circuit Circus 1,600 rooms opened at all. Again, in the seasonal peak for the market and then New Orleans, New Orleans is a significant national database receiver of business. People not traveling, New Orleans as a market is their restrictions are stricter than the state itself. You have legislative mandated labor count in New Orleans and you have a tax system where we paid a fixed rate in the quarter versus the variable rate that we typically pay. So those three properties are significant drags.

As we move into fourth quarter and you get into the shoulder season, Reno and Atlantic City look a lot better, because you're doing pretty well on a comp basis mid week in those markets when properties work for this time last year and the weekend drop off is not nearly what it was in the summer. New Orleans still has all of the same issues that it had in the third quarter.

Chad Beynon -- Macquarie -- Analyst

Great. Thanks, Tom. Really helpful. And then Bret, just on the cash flow side, could you just remind us in terms of what the annual or quarterly cash interest and cash rent will be a little bit of noise in the reporting here. But that would be helpful?

Bret Yunker -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes, putting GAAP aside on a pure cash basis we're roughly $2 billion all-in of annual master lease, rent payments and interest expense. So you can just divide that by four for the quarters.

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

About $1.2 billion of rent and $800 million of interest.

Chad Beynon -- Macquarie -- Analyst

Great, thank you guys.

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks.

Your next question comes from Dan Politzer with JP Morgan.

Dan Politzer -- JP Morgan -- Analyst

Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping that you could give maybe an update on your iGaming rollout. And when we could expect to see your launch in Pennsylvania more formally at least? And maybe if there is any plans for Michigan. And if you have a market access agreement there?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes, on Michigan, an intention to rollout there. Pennsylvania I don't know...

Anthony Carano -- President and Chief Operating Officer

We are live in Pennsylvania, Dan, right now. We're rolling out more product and more games as every day and week passes. So, we're expecting to see incremental opportunities in 2021 as these new products are rolled out. So we would be optimistic in Pennsylvania in 2021. Also in the State of New Jersey, we're going to be launching live dealer on the Caesars side for iGaming. So that's an exciting opportunity as well.

Dan Politzer -- JP Morgan -- Analyst

Got it, thanks. And then, in Virginia, there was recently passed legislation that legalized gaming in Danville, where you talked about building a Casino. Can you maybe talk to us about a little bit about the project, potential cost and return to competitor environment there and how you're thinking about this at a high level?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes, so the project that was approved, we'd expect 20% returns on roughly a $400 million investment. Keep in mind, as you look at that project that's in the radius of the Cherokee property that we operate in North Carolina. And the tribe has the opportunity in the option to opt into up to 80% of the equity of the Danville property, and that became available to them upon the passage of the vote on Tuesday. So it's too early to say where that will eventually head.

Dan Politzer -- JP Morgan -- Analyst

Got it. Thanks so much guys. Appreciate it.

Operator

Your next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies.

David Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Hi. Afternoon. And thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the WMH acquisition and essentially, why now, and the degree to which you get close on it, what kind of tech investment and/or marketing spend you envision might be required to be a leader with it or could be successful with it?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So we -- as we looked at the opportunity in this space, as I've said, I think this is the most significant growth opportunity in the casino space since riverboats were legalized in the 90s. We were looking at the partnership that we brought in from the Eldorado side where if you recall, we entered that partnership knowing that Eldorado's brand was unlikely to play on a national basis. We wanted to form a partnership with a respected sports betting operator that had a national strategy where we could participate in the upside. We subsequently bought Caesars, who obviously has a very different brand situation than Eldorado, and it became clear that we have a brand that can resonate on a national level. We've got a database that can feed into that business and we have been talking about how should we proceed with the partnership. If you recall the partnership included sports betting and not -- include sports betting and not Internet casino. If you're going to get to a single wallet solution, you need both. So it really wasn't ideal for either partner in the current landscape. So as we looked at potential solutions, it became clear to us that the best answer for us was to control our own destiny here. And so we started discussions about a purchase and ended up where you saw us end up.

On the marketing question, yes, the combined company here -- the combined pro forma entity iGaming and sports does about $100 million -- will do about $100 million in EBITDA, positive EBITDA not the $200 million, $300 million of negative EBITDA that you are accustomed to in this space, it will do $100 million of positive EBITDA, that includes all of the marketing that we're doing now. So if you see us ramp-up marketing, it's from an EBITDA positive position. In terms of the tax spend, William Hill has been spending a significant amount of capital, developing its Liberty platform that rolled out in New Jersey to strong reviews. They are in the process of continuing to roll that out throughout the US. You're never going to stop spending on tech, but I don't see a significant material tax spend that's -- you should be plugging into your model, that's going to be a giant sort of cash. You should be thinking $10 million, $20 million a year neighborhood.

David Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Okay. And I recall, I hope I have your terminology correct. But the notion that iGaming and Sports Betting may warrant its own brain at some point. How have you thought about making sure that that business can grow and achieve what it needs to achieve under your roof versus its own roof?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

So it will it will be an unrestricted sub of Caesars Entertainment upon closing, post to the Caesars acquisition, Eric Hession and Chris Holdren out of the Caesars side, agreed to stay on as co-President's of that business for us. Christine Stuart on the operation side has been invaluable in this process for us, will remain involved. So you will see it as it will operate as a subsidiary of its own. You will be able to see the numbers of it on its own. Then the question becomes, what's the best structure from a capital markets perspective? And we have time to make those decisions. The expectation at the outset is it will be a wholly owned unrestricted sub of Caesars Entertainment will not have its own currency, but as you know, we are 100% focused on driving value to our shareholders and if the right answer is, it becomes a separate entity with its own currency, you might see us head in that direction in the future.

David Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Great, thank you so much.

Operator

Your next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist Securities.

Barry Jonas -- Truist Securities -- Analyst

Hey, guys. I wanted to start with Vegas. Can you maybe just talk about the reintroduction of entertainment. How profitable do you think that can be either directly or indirectly. And then also what's been the response so far to the return of paid parking? Thanks.

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes, so on the question of entertainment, we're absolutely thrilled that we've seen movement in that area and the ability to operate what are some fairly small venue entertainment across the city, what you're seeing coming back, you're not seeing headlined Entertainment come back, you are not seeing big production shows come back, what you're seeing are the 500 to 600 seats that are now offering 100 to 200 seats. It's not a hugely profitable business on its own. But it creates additional reason to visit the market and that's important to us. Every piece that we get that becomes another reason for someone to make the move to either drive here or fly here and stay in the market is good for the whole market. So we're extremely pleased that we're able to offer Entertainment today. The initial response has been extremely strong and we're happy to have it back.

On the issue of parking, you've got a heavy drive-in business now, as I said we're mid to high 90s occupancy on the weekends as you -- and you know that we have kind of 50-yard line real estate on the strip. So we were finding was our best customers were having difficulty finding parking in our garages even if they had a lodging reservation. And so what we wanted to do was to bring back parking for -- to bring back parking fees as kind of hurdle so that our best customers can get to the property. If you are significant to Caesars or a customer you are a larger of you're a local, you're not paying for parking and to drive home the point that this was for those purposes, and because of the situation that we've seen in the radar, we -- as we implemented, we said we are going to donate all of our profits from parking for this quarter and next to the local charities that support the community and those that have been displaced by COVID. So the response has been overwhelmingly positive from the city and from our customers.

Barry Jonas -- Truist Securities -- Analyst

That's great. And then just a follow-up. How are you thinking about I guess PropCo mix to the business. Now, Tom in the past you've talked about sort of like a 50-50 mix. Is that still the goal once the dust settles?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes, you should see us doing a sale-leaseback transactions of or sales of real estate that will skew that as you've seen us in the past we've utilized the PropCo market for financing typically for transactions. So were there something to come up that made sense. It could be a tool that used, but I don't expect us to be particularly acquisitive from here. So you shouldn't see much movement on the real estate side.

Barry Jonas -- Truist Securities -- Analyst

Great. Thank you so much.

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks Barry.

Your next question comes from Shaun Kelly with Bank of America.

Shaun Kelly -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Hi. Good afternoon everyone. Two questions. Just wanted to go back to the sort of regional margin performance. If we look at the kind of the numbers on a quarter basis, talking about the 700 basis points, is it fair just as we think about recognition of some of that synergy is going to be your initiative, that's got 700 basis points could actually improve or accelerate from here? Or do you think this is a good reflection of what the ability of the business can be when everything else is -- everything else starts to settle in?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

You should expect that there is -- that it can continue to grow, because as I talked about earlier, what's missing from the business is some of your highest flow through revenue. So as that starts to come back into these markets that I'm thinking particularly of Atlantic City, Reno and New Orleans, flow through is quite high and their contribution to the total regional pie in a post-COVID world should drive the entire regional sector margin higher.

Shaun Kelly -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

That's really helpful, Tom. And then sort of a separate the big picture strategic question. So there's been some discussion as it relates to William Hill. And I guess the bigger kind of picture strategy here as it relates to this kind of single wallet or access to the customer probably be via an app. And I'm just kind of curiously Caesars always took a pretty centralized or increasingly move to a centralized marketing approach. Tom at Eldorado I think without mischaracterizing you guys always pretty focused on a decentralized approach truly accessing the customers empowering some of the local property managers. How do you think about that in the digital realm. So just sort of how do you kind of like connect all this together as it relates to software and one vision of the customer. Does it sort of need to be centralized or can you balance those two approaches and how would you sort of go about doing it or is there anything need to change?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

I mean I think as you think about it as to how we operate the entire business, what will differentiate us in this space is the stickiness of our customers, the immersion in our network. If you think about I know you're in the free-COVID world you would -- you would be a frequent traveler like I was think of the gymnastics, you would go through to make sure that you are flying on your favorite airline or you're staying in your hotel where you've got the most points, that's what we've got in the Caesars Reward system and it's a much broader relationship then just how much money did I give you to place your sports bet on my app, it's a much stickier customers. So you shouldn't think of the sports betting marketing is going to be materially different than the way that we built the business on the bricks and mortar side. I understand there's this race for market share and handle and all the numbers that come out monthly right now. This is a long game.

I go back to my riverboats example. I remember calling on names like Casino Magic and Casino America and players international are Argosy Gaming. All of those ultimately went away and got consolidated into the leaders in the business that's where we're going to end up. You are in inning one of you know if you're thinking in baseball terms what ultimately will be an extra-inning game and we're assembling the building blocks to be a winner here long-term to attract as much share market share as we can over time profitably, but make sure that it's sticky. I can make my market share in any individual market, look the way that I'd want it to look to report to you at the end of the month if I throw enough money at it. That's not how we do business. That's not how you should expect us to tackle this area.

Shares of DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) sank 39.8% in October, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The online betting company's stock fell after a large share sale valuing the company significantly lower than previous highs.

DraftKings, which had its initial public offering in April, sold 32 million shares on Oct. 7 at at a price of $52 per share. The $1.6 billion sale, which saw half of shares sold by DraftKings and half by investors, raised roughly $830 million in funds for the company. That valuation came in significantly below the stock's closing price of $56.79 the day before the new offering, and shares continued to move lower as the month progressed.

So what

The potential for additional share offerings and dilution likely caused DraftKings stock to continue trending lower following the Oct. 7 sale. The company had roughly 376 million shares outstanding after the new stock offering, with roughly half of the company's shares being owned by insiders and the other half being freely tradable. The company's share price may have also faced additional pressure in the lead up to, and following, an unspecified amount of insider-held stock becoming tradable on Oct. 20.

DraftKings likely also felt the impact from coronavirus-related pressures last month. Postponement for some NFL games due to confirmed cases of COVID-19 among some players and staff elevated the risk that the season would be disrupted, but it looks like those potential issues have been resolved through rescheduling.

Now what

DraftKings stock has regained some ground early in November's trading. Shares are up roughly 6% in the month so far.

The market for online betting has big room for growth, but DraftKings' future will be shaped by an uncertain regulatory climate and the prospect of tough competition even if lawmakers take soft stances on the industry.

Why DraftKings Stock Is Up 5% Today,Motley Fool,4 days ago,"Shares of fantasy sports and sports betting app DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) jumped 9% at the market open today, and are up more than 5% as of 11:25 a.m. ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/04/why-draftkings-stock-is-up-5-today/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","What happened

Shares of fantasy sports and sports betting app DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) jumped 9% at the market open today, and are up more than 5% as of 11:25 a.m. EST. Sports betting ballot initiatives were passed in three more states in yesterday's election.

The approvals bring the total to 21 states and Washington, D.C., where sports betting is legal in the U.S.

So what

Voters in Maryland, Louisiana, and South Dakota are the latest to legalize in-person and/or online sports betting in their states.

As more states legalize sports betting, the line between online betting and retail sportsbooks is getting blurred. DraftKings and competitor FanDuel have been increasing partnerships with brick-and-mortar casinos to expand offerings.

Now what

DraftKings now has casino partners in eight states. It also has an agreement with Turner Sports, giving it the rights to display its fantasy sports and sports betting content on select Turner Sports and Bleacher Report television programs.

DraftKings has been a popular growth stock since its IPO in April 2020, even though the COVID-19 pandemic has limited sporting events significantly. Its shares have more than doubled since that time.

The continued wave of states allowing sports betting could result in a $58 billion market, when you include online casino gambling, according to Needham analyst Brad Erickson. Besides FanDuel, DraftKings competitors include MGM Resorts International and Penn National Gaming, both of which combine online apps with a physical casino presence.",draftkings,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.925, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': 0.296}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.925, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': 0.296}]",0.296,0.0,0.296,0.19733333333333333,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Positive,Neutral,Somewhat Positive

Shares of DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) climbed 9% on Thursday after voters in three more states approved measures to legalize sports betting.

So what

Maryland, South Dakota, and Louisiana will soon allow bets to be placed on sporting events. They'll join 21 other states that already allow such wagers. As a leading daily fantasy sports contest and sports betting platform, DraftKings -- and its investors -- stand to profit handsomely from these developments.

Now what

The pace of legalization appears set to accelerate in the coming year, as more states turn to sports betting to help shore up tax revenue bases depleted during the COVID-19 crisis. In turn, the online sports betting and gambling market could eventually generate $58 billion in annual revenue in the U.S. alone, according to some analysts.

DraftKings has moved aggressively to make the most of this tantalizing growth opportunity. The hard-charging company has struck deals with ESPN and multiple sports teams in recent months -- all of which are designed to keep its brand top of mind among bettors. DraftKings is also flush with cash after its recent share offerings, which should give it the capital it needs to continue heavy investments in its growth initiatives.",draftkings,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.661, 'pos': 0.339, 'compound': 0.4767}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.661, 'pos': 0.339, 'compound': 0.4767}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.23835,0.0,0.23835,0.1589,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Positive,Neutral,Somewhat Positive
Should You Buy Caesars Before There's a Coronavirus Vaccine?,Motley Fool,5 days ago,"... at only $3.8 billion by investors, 15% of online sports betting company DraftKings' (NASDAQ:DKNG) value, yet has the same revenue potential as DraftKings.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/03/should-you-buy-caesars-before-theres-a-coronavirus/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Despite rolling ""snake eyes"" when the coronavirus pandemic caused lockdowns throughout the U.S. earlier this year, gambling companies are showing signs of life as many states begin to allow limited reopening of casinos. Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) saw a 22% rebound in September, likely related both to its ESPN partnership and its announced acquisition plans for English sportsbook company William Hill (LSE:WMH).

While Caesars isn't faring badly in its recovery, its stock still hasn't regained the full value it had before the coronavirus struck. Additionally, the rise of COVID-19 hospitalizations could be threatening another wave of lockdowns and an abrupt drop in the modest gains made by in-casino gambling during the summer months. With the earliest possible release of COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. still roughly two months away, according to a recent estimate from Dr. Anthony Fauci, Fools investing in consumer discretionary stocks might want to weigh several factors before buying shares of Caesars.

The current situation for casinos

While casinos have made a partial comeback from the disastrous days of March, April, and May, potential storm clouds still lurk on the horizon for physical casino locations. The Nevada Gaming Control Board reports total gaming win for August 2020 was down 22.08% year over year, while, for September 2020, total gaming win fell 22.38% compared to the year-ago figure. On the Las Vegas Strip itself, gaming win plunged 39.14% year over year.

The difference in lost Nevada gaming win between August and September is only slight, but it shows the recovery has plateaued, at least for the time being, and could even potentially reverse if a new outbreak intensifies. Additionally, while the metrics only show the gaming win from a single state, Nevada is a good barometer of legal gambling activity throughout the U.S. Nevada's gross gaming revenue (GGR) of $12 billion in 2019 dwarfed the second-largest state GGR, $3.5 billion in New Jersey, and accounted for 27.5% of the $43.6 billion national GGR, according to Statista research.

Furthermore, COVID-19 could be winding up to deliver another economic blow to the hospitality and gambling industry. The Week reports that hospitalizations are setting new records in 13 U.S. states, and while Nevada is not among them, the trend could still scare off potential visitors and depress leisure travel's recovery. More than 1,000 people in the U.S. are dying daily from the coronavirus again, too, potentially making physical visits to casinos and resorts less attractive, even with beefed-up sanitation and social distancing.

Nevada itself isn't yet breaking its previous records, but cases there have also shown a sharp recent upswing. The key market for Caesars' in-casino revenue is currently in a ""red zone,"" with rising infection rates and moderate to high levels of community transmission in 71% of Nevada counties.

How is Caesars holding up?

Caesars' third-quarter results are due out Nov. 5 and will provide a clearer picture of its current situation, but enough information is available now to get decent understanding of the company's position. Beyond the fluff of bringing live entertainment back to the Strip and other marketing gestures, the company has several important strengths likely to come into play in the medium to long term.

The July merger of Eldorado Resorts and Caesars into the single Caesars Entertainment entity created a massive enterprise, the biggest casino company in the U.S., with a presence in 16 states and approximately 55 properties, with eight located on the Las Vegas Strip. Combining the two companies should allow the newly minted Caesars to cut expenses by $500 million within the first year after closing, or in other words by July 2021, according to executive statements.

Placing all of the geographically far-flung properties of the two entities under a single management structure will almost certainly allow CEO Tom Reeg to eliminate a lot of redundancy and administrative bloat. According to some forecasts, the larger, leaner casino could see revenue exceed $8.75 billion, amounting to a 114% increase, once the brake of COVID-19's economic effect is released.

Caesars is also diversifying its strategic approach with an aggressive push into digital sports betting, one of 2020's major growth sectors. Caesars recently bought online bookmaker William Hill, and an analysis by casino investment bank Union Gaming suggests the market may be seriously undervaluing the acquisition's potential. The research claims the William Hill purchase is being valued at only $3.8 billion by investors, 15% of online sports betting company DraftKings' (NASDAQ:DKNG) value, yet has the same revenue potential as DraftKings.

Even if Union Gaming's specific estimates are ignored, Caesars said in a press release it made the acquisition based on a ""compelling strategic rationale,"" driven by such factors as ""a potential total addressable market size ranging up to $30-35 billion."" It also cited its ability to completely develop William Hill's American sports betting and online betting operations by merging them into its own, meshing them with Caesars' exclusive partnerships with a range of sports teams, and giving Caesars' 60 million-strong loyalty members immediate access to wagering through William Hill, where legal.

Sports betting, including online forms, has shown vigorous growth over the past few years, and extremely strong gains in 2020. According to Zion Market Research, the sector could see an 8.83% compound annual growth rate through 2024, rising to approximately $155 billion by that year.

To buy or not to buy

Buying stock in Caesars Entertainment before there's a COVID-19 vaccine seems like a potentially rewarding move for those interested in casino investments. In fact, with COVID-19 keeping Caesars' share price near or below pre-pandemic levels for the moment, this could be viewed as a buying opportunity. Caesars proved its ability to reach higher prices even before many of the benefits of its recent moves -- including the merger and its William Hill acquisition -- entered completely into the equation.

The true potential of many 2020 developments will be fully unlocked once COVID-19 is controlled by a vaccine. Today's larger, more efficient Caesars, with casinos and other properties in 16 U.S. states and abroad, is well-positioned to meet pent-up demand both in Las Vegas and beyond, once resort and gambling demand returns to full strength. In the meantime, its robust entry into the explosively growing digital sportsbook market taps another major revenue source, one immune to COVID-19 and likely to continue growing even in a post-coronavirus world.

When that day arrives, those who added the casino company to their portfolio before the vaccine will likely see a significant jump in the value of their holdings, perhaps even as high as the $100 per share predicted by some analysts, making this a good stock to consider buying now.",draftkings,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.906, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': 0.34}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.906, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': 0.34}]",0.34,0.0,0.34,0.22666666666666668,Somewhat Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive
Worried About a Stock Market Crash? 5 Steps to Take Right Now,Motley Fool,2 days ago,"DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) wasn't on many investors' radars, for instance, at the end of last year. But, with shutdowns forcing millions of people to stay at home ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/06/worried-about-a-stock-market-crash-5-steps-to-take/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","If you're worried the foreseeable future could be rough on stocks, you're not alone. Members of both of the country's major political parties are fairly confident ""the other guy"" will prove problematic for the economy if he is elected president of the United States. Plus, a resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic led to record-breaking levels of new cases last month. Another round of pandemic-related shutdowns may be ahead, and it's not clear if the fragile U.S. economy can handle it.

If you're more convinced than not that action has to be taken sooner than later with your investment portfolio to account for these uncertainties, here are five common-sense moves you can make right now to shield your portfolio from a potential implosion.

1. Shed your weakest, most speculative holdings

Investors have a tendency think -- and act -- a little more aggressively the longer a rally lasts, leading them to make bets they might not make early on in an expansion period. DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) wasn't on many investors' radars, for instance, at the end of last year. But, with shutdowns forcing millions of people to stay at home and find new sources of entertainment, the sports betting platform has been all the rage despite its lack of profitability and sky-high valuation of nearly 40 times its trailing revenue.

Hype and gains may have prompted traders to look past those details at the time, but a crash sparked by an actual economic contraction could cause these bettors to tighten their purse strings.

2. Beef up exposure all-weather stocks

While costly hobbies like sports betting may be the first to suffer should the market environment turn ugly, there are some consumer goods -- like food and personal hygiene supplies -- most people won't stop purchasing. That bodes well for brands like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Clorox (NYSE:CLX). The former is the name behind Pampers diapers, Tide detergent, and Gillette razors. The latter is of course the supplier of (among other things) a popular brand of bleach.

Note that all stock sell-offs have the potential to drag down all names, particularly when they first get going. Investors' worries are wide-sweeping when the initial shock of a correction sets in, and the selling can be indiscriminate. Eventually, though, the market starts to sort out the names that are truly impacted and the ones that are better defended from potential economic woes.

3. Buy some (cheap) put options

If you're not versed in equity or index options, now's not the time to start figuring them out. In simplest terms, a call option is a bet on price appreciation, while a put option is a bet on falling prices for a stock or index. There are nuances to puts and calls, however, that can make them tricky to trade. (There's also the not-so-small fact that your broker must approve you for options trading, which can take time.)

If you've worked with options before, however, this might be the time to step into some puts -- the cheaper, the better.

Why lower-cost options? The obvious answer is that right now, they cost less, which means you can commit less capital to such a trade. In this case, though, you also want cheap put options because this position will only serve as a sort of insurance policy you don't actually want to use. The purpose in this situation is only to shield yourself from a major setback for a finite period of time. If you buy them and are them unable to exercise them because the market never crashes, that's not necessarily a bad thing.

Tip: Don't try and hedge an entire portfolio from a market crash just using options. Just curbing some of the impact of a steep sell-off is still a win.

4. Go for the gold

Gold and other precious metals should be a part of most diversified portfolios, as these commodities are not correlated well with equities. Basically, when stocks are underperforming, there's a good chance other investments like gold are outperforming. Ditto for bonds.

This inverse relationship isn't etched in stone, for the record. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEMKT:GLD) fell with the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) in late February and early March when the pandemic first took hold. The two recovered in tandem beginning with March's reversal as well. That's more of an exception to the norm than the norm itself, though. The reverse correlation is at least reliable enough to make gold a decent hedge if a crash is inevitable from here.

5. Take a breath, and keep it in perspective

Finally, bear in mind that just because the financial media has led you to believe a market meltdown is brewing doesn't necessarily make it so. As the old cliche goes, fear sells. A correction may be more muted and not qualify as a ""crash,"" or it may not transpire at all.

And even if a correction does take shape, it may not matter for very long. As Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Samuelson put it all the way back in 1966, ""declines in U.S. stock prices had correctly predicted nine of the last five American recessions."" In other words, there's a good chance any near-term crash will be short-lived, as the economy won't correspondingly implode with it. It's entirely possible doing nothing and riding out the volatility is prudent, too.",draftkings,"[{'neg': 0.551, 'neu': 0.449, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5994}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.0,-0.2997,0.0,-0.0999,Somewhat Negative,Neutral,Somewhat Negative,Neutral

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the third-quarter 2020 Roku earnings conference Call. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Conrad Grodd, vice president, investor relations.

Please go ahead, sir.

Conrad Grodd -- Vice President, Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to Roku's financial results conference call for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020. I'm joined on the call today with Anthony Wood, Roku's founder and CEO; Steve Louden, our CFO; and Scott Rosenberg, senior vice president, general manager of our platform business, who will be available for Q&A. Full details of our results and additional management commentary are available in our shareholder letter, which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.roku.com.

The following discussions, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, November 5, 2020, only, and we do not undertake any obligations to update or revise this information.

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019. Now I'd like to hand the call over to Anthony.

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you for joining today's call. Q3 was remarkable for our industry and for Roku. More American consumers streamed to their TV than ever before. This included free ad-supported services as well as live programming and subscription.

The Roku Channel benefited from offering all three. Major media companies continue to reorganize around streaming. They embrace Roku because of our scale and content marketing capabilities. Partnering with Roku is an efficient way to build and retain large and valuable audiences.

Advertisers reassessed their TV upfront advertising commitments and moved significant portions of their investments to connected TV platforms like Roku. Advertising with Roku gave marketers significant incremental reach over linear TV as well as advanced capabilities to target their advertising and to measure its effectiveness. Streaming is stoking innovation and giving greater choice, value and control to consumers. Despite the ongoing uncertainty caused by the pandemic, Roku's long-term prospects are strong and our outstanding financial and operational performance in Q3 shows the inherent leverage in our business model.

With that, I'll hand it over to Steve.

Steve Louden -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Anthony. Before we take your questions, I'll walk through operational and financial highlights and discuss our viewpoint looking forward. We added 2.9 million incremental active accounts in Q3 and ended the quarter with 46 million active accounts, up 43% year over year. Sales of player units rapidly accelerated, up 57% year over year, while average selling price decreased only 1% year over year given less promotional activity due to strong demand resulting in tight inventory levels for certain products.

This extraordinary level of player unit growth was driven by a confluence of factors, including significant retailer channel inventory replenishment after strong Q2 player sales, continued robust demand for streaming players in Q3 and a portion of holiday inventory arriving at the end of Q3. Engagement on the platform continues to grow with Roku users streaming 14.8 billion hours in the quarter, up 54% year over year, and streaming hours per active account increasing at a more normalized rate of 9% year over year as COVID-related restrictions were lifted during the summer. Now I'd like to highlight a few financial items. Q3 saw record total revenues of $452 million, up 73% year over year, driven by robust growth in both the platform and player segments.

Platform segment revenue was up 78% year over year to $319 million driven by broad-based strength in both our advertising and content distribution businesses. Roku monetized video ad impressions reaccelerated to almost 90% year over year in Q3 versus roughly 50% year over year in Q2 as advertisers leaned into Roku, shifting dollars to streaming as they follow TV viewership and take advantage of increased flexibility given disruptions to the traditional TV upfront process. The content business benefited from our rapid rate of active account growth as well as strong consumer demand for ad-supported viewing, subscription services and premium movie rentals. Reflecting these factors in our content distribution deal modeled to some significant increases in the estimated lifetime deal values with an outsized portion of that value change accounted for in Q3.

As a reminder, revenue recognition for our content distribution agreements can be lumpy quarter to quarter. Player revenue grew 62% year over year, the highest growth rate in over seven years, which was driven by an extraordinary level of player unit growth, as mentioned previously. Gross profit grew faster than revenue, up 81% year over year in Q3, to $215 million. Gross margin of 47.6% increased on both a year-over-year and sequential basis driven by strong segment margins.

Platform gross margin of 61% expanded over 400 basis points versus the first half of 2020 due to margin improvements in both ads and content distribution. Player gross margin of 15% was significantly higher than the same period last year due to fewer promotions as well as lower return rates. Q3 adjusted EBITDA of $56 million was a record, eclipsing the total adjusted EBITDA in 2019 by more than 50%. This outsized level of adjusted EBITDA was the result of several positive trends combining in the quarter but also highlights the inherent leverage of the Roku business model as the platform continues to gain scale and monetization increases.

We exited the quarter with a strong cash and liquidity position, raising an incremental $148 million in equity capital via an at-the-market offering, resulting in over $1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments. We also have $69 million of available liquidity under our credit facility. Similar to last quarter, we do not intend to provide formal guidance for Q4 given that the short-term macro environment remains both variable and uncertain. We are closely tracking the potential for COVID-19 or economic-related disruptions as well as the potential impact to historical consumer spending levels or shopping patterns as we enter the holiday season.

Instead, we will provide a framework on how we believe the quarter could develop. Coming now to Q3, we are pleased with the resilience of our business and cautiously optimistic about the holiday season. Barring any significant external risk factors materializing, we estimate that the overall Q4 year-over-year revenue growth will be roughly in line with the last few holiday seasons, which was in the mid-40% range. We expect platform revenue to account for roughly two-thirds of total revenue.

As I mentioned earlier, Q3 revenue benefited from material deal value increases that we do not anticipate will be replicated in Q4. Also, this quarter, we will be lapping the anniversary of our dataxu acquisition, along with certain content distribution launches. Like past holiday seasons, we plan to keep Q4 player gross margins close to breakeven. While we anticipate Q4 platform gross margins to be between the mid-50% and 60%, which is similar to levels seen in Q2 and Q3 this year.

We anticipate the sequential growth in operating expenses from Q3 to Q4 to be in line with last year, driven primarily by headcount and sales and marketing growth. As a reminder, quarterly operating expense levels from Q1 to Q3 remained relatively consistent, in part, due to steps we took at the outset of the pandemic to slow the rate of growth of our opex. In summary, we are very pleased with the overall resiliency of our business and with our outstanding Q3 performance. Despite the macro uncertainty, we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow our business into the future and believe that pandemic has only accelerated the long-term trend toward all TV being streamed.

With that, let's turn the call over for questions. Operator?

Questions & Answers:

Operator

Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Ralph Schackart with William Blair. Your line is open.

Ralph Schackart -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Steve, just wanted to get some perspective on the Q4 guide, if I could. Obviously, mid-40% growth is great.

But just sort of looking relative to what you posted, 73% growth in Q3. Just curious if there's just added conservatism there. I'm sure there's a big element of the outsized portion of the deal that got recognized in Q3. So just any extra color there.

And if you could perhaps give some quantification or some more color on how large the outsized portion of the deal was in Q3 would be great.

Steve Louden -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. Rob, thanks for the question. Yeah. As you mentioned, I mean, Q3 was an outstanding quarter.

It's a confluence of very positive trends, record player growth. TV sales were great with our partners. And then strong performances on both the advertising and the content distribution side, including calling up on several of our deal models, the lifetime values there. In terms of Q4, I think the important thing to just focus on is there's a lot of uncertainty and variability that remains out there in the macro environment, everything from COVID-related resurgences in the U.S.

and around the world to the shape of the holiday season as well as consumer spending levels. So that's -- these are all things we're tracking, which is why we're not giving a formal outlook. So certainly, you referenced some of our color. I mean, we're very happy with the trajectory and the resilience of the business to date, and so we're cautiously optimistic on the holiday season and think it could look similar to the last couple of holiday seasons, which were in the mid-40% year-over-year growth range on a revenue basis.

As I mentioned in my remarks, we don't anticipate significant deal value changes in Q4, although that's -- obviously, we do that analysis every quarter. The other thing I'll note just that's factored into those thoughts is the fact that in Q4, we are lapping the dataxu acquisition, which came onboard mid-Q4 as well as launches of some certain new services in Q4. So those are also factors that are -- that were included in our thinking there.

Ralph Schackart -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

OK.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from Laura Martin with Needham. Your line is open.

Laura Martin -- Needham and Company -- Analyst

Great results, guys. Scott, let's start with you. I'm very interested in this sentence, the question I get the most is dataxu. Why did they buy it? And why does it matter? And I'm very interested here in these words that say, ""focused on new products like incremental reach guarantees."" Could you talk about how dataxu is giving you new products that weren't available before with this one new platform? And then for you, Anthony, you guys stay in the letter, 75% player growth year over year.

Does that imply that our mix of TV ads is now pivoted toward player -- away from the 50-50 mix toward players and our soundbars having an influence on that extra outperformance or not?

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Laura, it's Scott here. Thanks for the question. I'll talk a little bit about the context around dataxu and then provide some broader color on the newer ad products you referenced. We bought dataxu really to bring the same unique advantages we've had in the media business to a broader platform to a broader scale.

Since acquiring dataxu, we've rebranded it and relaunched it as OneView, the OneView ad platform. And we've been layering in a bunch of new features, including, for example, as you referenced, the ability to manage reach and frequency broadly across the marketers. Complete buy, so whether they're buying media from Roku or media from a publisher on Roku or media off Roku entirely, they can manage that and orchestrate that all within OneView and leverage our identity and data in -- at the same time. The incremental reach product that you're referencing is actually something we took into the upfront, and it was a -- we stepped it up.

For several years now, we've been highlighting our ability to measure reach and frequency across linear and OTT, which is a key trigger for marketers to choose to invest into OTT. This year, we stepped it up and offered guarantees in the upfront. We would guarantee that we would deliver true incremental reach over linear to marketers. So overall, tons of progress on OneView.

Significant media spend through OneView occurring in the quarter year over year, and we're really just getting going. We've got brands like DraftKings, for example, who is a big sports spender, had to shift budgets out of TV as sports was canceled and delayed, has moved a significant portion of their budget into OTT and is yet now managing most of their spend, their cross-channel spend, through OneView. That's just one example. Lexus, the national team, is really leaning into our unique capabilities, adding its on-the-home-screen sponsorable experiences and then using OneView to reach consumers off Roku for that one-two punch of a cross-platform reach.

So overall, we're very excited about progress we've made with OneView. Anthony, do you want to take the second question?

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Laura, so I think the stat you're referring to is player unit sales were up 57% year over year. Which is a great number for us. In certain international markets, like in Canada and the U.K., players unit sales actually doubled year over year.

And then Roku TVs also had an extremely strong quarter. They continue to perform very well. So we saw -- and then audio products like we just introduced, the Streambar and we have some other audio products in the market, those are still not -- still a lot smaller than player unit sales, but those are growing as well. So I think we're seeing our active account growth engines on all fronts doing really well, and the result was active accounts in the quarter were up 43% year over year to 46 million, which is great.

And we also -- I mean, we also sell lots of units that don't result in a new active account, but they result in more Rokus going into existing Roku households, which strengthens our relationship with those customers as well.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.

Michael Nathanson -- MoffettNathanson -- Analyst

Thanks. I have a couple. Whoever wants them, please do. Can you talk a bit about The Roku Channel this quarter? It looks like streaming hours slowed down a bit.

That makes sense, but Roku Channel picked up a ton of share. So what's behind that? And then I thought it was interesting that you guys announced a deal with Amazon to move Roku Channel across their platform. What does that do to perhaps to your content strategy and your partner's willingness to work with you? And do you see one day maybe moving to more original content as you build that Roku Channel further?

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Michael, this is Anthony. Yes, so The Roku Channel is doing extremely well. It's an important asset for us, and reach doubled in The Roku Channel in the quarter. But I think Scott will be best to answer most of your questions.

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yeah. It really was an incredible quarter for The Roku Channel. Active account growth now reaching active accounts with about 54 million people, double the pace of an already fast-growing underlying platform in terms of hours and reach, growing faster than any other top 10 channel. Some of this was driven, in part, by the launch of our EPG, our live channel grid, which we began rolling out in June.

It's a great product, a great way to channel surf. All this growth really accrues to Roku's benefit but also, of course, our partners who are participating and putting content into The Roku Channel. So partner earnings within The Roku Channel more than doubled in the quarter. So overall, really strong performance for The Roku Channel.

As -- in answer your question about sort of content and off platform, as The Roku Channel grows and generates even bigger and better financial outcomes for our partners, it just attracts more partners, more content, depth, more verticals. It opens up yet more possibilities for programming for us as a platform. So it's a real vehicle for us in terms of the value that it creates for our users, for Roku and for content partners participating in it. Regarding off-platform syndication of The Roku Channel, our primary focus as a company remains on our platform where we have the greatest advantages about The Roku Channel.

Our primary focus as a company remains on our platform where we have the greatest advantages, the marketing tools, the reach, data, but free, especially AVOD is a powerful recipe. And so where we see an opportunity to take The Roku Channel on to other platforms, we will explore it.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc. Your line is open.

Justin Patterson -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Great. Thank you very much. I was hoping to get a finer point on the shopper data program with Kroger. How has the uptake been with CPGs? And how many other opportunities like this, could you envision out there down the road?

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Scott, do you want to take that?

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes. Well, of course, CPG, as an advertiser category is an enormous category. And especially, I think COVID has taught us just how much consumers are willing to move their shopping online. The Kroger deal has been a very strong deal for us in terms of signaling what we're capable of given our scale and our data.

We mentioned in the shareholder letter that Snyder's, for example, saw a 250% return on ad spend. We have a bunch of brands now in and leveraging that program. And there are lots of opportunities. It is a big market.

The key for us as a platform is that first-party customer relationship and our reach into our platform with advertising. So we anticipate lots more to come on that. CPG became our fastest-growing vertical in the quarter, just as an indicator of how much potential there is.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Mr.

Helfstein, your line is open.

Jason Helfstein -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst

Thank you. So Steve, just -- can you go into a bit more detail? I mean, you called out that you had an -- you recognize an outsized portion of the content distribution lifetime value in the quarter. I think second quarter kind of also benefited, maybe you didn't call it out as much in the letter, but I recall, I think there was something in the Q about it. I mean, just help us understand kind of what those triggers are because it feels like this kind of is actually a pattern because it's a strong part of your business.

And then just with one of you, I mean, how do we think about the sizing, if we think out over the next two years? I mean, you gave some commentary in the letter with DraftKings, but I mean kind of how meaningful could that become over the next two years?

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Steve, do you want to take the first question?

Steve Louden -- Chief Financial Officer

Sure. Jason, thanks for the question. Yeah, in terms of the content distribution deal models, and this is a similar quarterly view that we -- or analysis that we do for other types of deals as well, we're in 606 accounting. We are valuing the lifetime of the deal and the content distribution deals are generally a year or two.

And so we see trends, what we're trying to better understand is whether those trends are sustainable and whether we should reflect them into the future periods. And in those cases, that can increase or decrease the overall level of the deal if they're positive or negative. In this case, in Q2, we obviously had trends that were in the early days of the pandemic in the lockdown. At that time, we didn't feel comfortable creating -- extrapolating those out too far.

But certainly, with more time, what we're seeing is a sustained acceleration in active accounts, as Anthony mentioned, driven by very strong player and TV sales as well as just very strong consumer demand for not only ad-supported viewing but also subscription services. The premium movie rental business that was pretty nascent has increased with some titles -- kind of notable titles there. And so in this case, we reassess these material deal models every quarter, but what we had was a portion of those increasing in deal values. And so that's reflected in that -- in the quarterly results because when you reflect an increase in deal value, an outsized portion of that is impacted to the current quarter.

The results can be lumpy with that. And certainly, as a reminder, that is increasing our assumptions for not only the current period but in future periods as well, which is why that can be lumpy on the quarter to quarter. So again, I think for us, I would say that, that process of looking at the deal model is definitely a quarterly part of the business, but it can go up or down. And in any given quarter, a lot of them kind of stay the same.

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Jason, let me take the second part of your question about OneView. It's a great question. Let me just -- without getting too frothy here, let me just take it in parts to highlight how big an opportunity this is for you, so -- for Roku. So on the Roku platform, we are fast growing, of course, as an ad sales team.

OneView allows us to access the yet additional, the still significant majority of impressions that are not sold by us. They're sold by publishers on our platform. It enables us to enable a marketer to use the same identity and data when buying elsewhere within the Roku ecosystem in the same way that they have been when they're buying media from Roku. But of course, as big as we are in OTT, there are other -- there's other video OTT media to be accessed outside of Roku.

So that's kind of a part two in terms of additional opportunity. And then, of course, there's omnichannel, there's desktop and mobile in tons of use cases of marketers who reach a user online and then want to retarget them in OTT, reach a user in OTT and then want to follow through on desktop and mobile. The opportunity here is really very significant for any marketer, and TV and OTT is a centerpiece in their marketing strategy. The key success factors, in our view, the right to win in our view as a platform and as a DSP really comes down, in our view, especially in this world of cookie challenges, device ID challenges is that first-party customer relationship, a platform at scale, advanced targeting and measurement, unique ad products.

These are all the things that we think make OneView strongly appealing to our clients.

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Jason, this is Anthony. Let me just add a couple of things. I would say from my point of view, the most interesting thing is that even though we have a nice robust ad business, the vast majority of advertising spend is still in linear television, it's not -- it's still not in streaming. And one of the interesting things in the quarter was the fact that advertisers are increasingly seeing streaming is something they need to start allocating a bigger portion of their budgets toward.

So it's still -- there's still a lot of opportunity because, of course, all those ads are going to switch to steaming eventually, and we think they're all going to be programmatic eventually as well through platforms like OneView.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Forte with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.

Thomas Forte -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst

Great. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask about the maturation of the AVOD market. So you talked about the changes to the upfront.

I thought that adding Roku Channel to Amazon Fire TV was a real milestone for the company. And on its earnings call, Amazon made very positive comments about the AVOD market and its own efforts. So I wanted to, in particular, talk about the maturation of AVOD, but two things in particular. What do you see as the opportunity for political ads on AVOD? And how did they perform in the quarter? And then what are your current thoughts on your international opportunity for AVOD?

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

So this is Anthony. I'll just say that AVOD is obviously a huge opportunity. We're very bullish on it. But I think Scott's best equipped to answer those questions.

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes. I mean, AVOD is vital to the OTT business model. You framed the question as maturation as though we're reaching maturation. I mean I think it's really still an extremely fast-growing and very high-potential market.

We see that in the pace of growth of The Roku Channel itself. We highlighted some stats in the shareholder letter. And I think if you look at new services coming to OTT, a majority of them are actually hybrid business models. They're subscription-based, but they're keeping the price down, and they're augmenting their revenue model through advertising.

I think also consumers have a somewhat limited budget for the number of services they're going to sign up where they're looking to save money as they leave the pay TV ecosystem. All to say, it just makes ad-supported experiences in the OTT environment that much more important. You asked about a political -- we had a strong participation in that category. Our capabilities are a key differentiator for political marketers.

But that said, it was a relatively modest contribution to an otherwise really big quarter for us in advertising. It was an important segment, a newer segment for us as a younger ad business. A great tenant to participate in, but certainly not anywhere close to a large share of our overall ad business.

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

And then on international, I can just say a few words on that. So if you just think big picture, what is our international strategy? Well, a big part of it is -- a lot of it is to replicate -- most of it actually is to replicate what we've done in the U.S. internationally. And in the U.S., we started by just focusing on building active accounts and then as we started to reach scale, layering on monetization options.

And that's what we're doing internationally as well. So we're focused primarily in this phase on building scale in the key markets. And then as we start to reach scale, we'll start to layer on monetization options. And that started, but it's still pretty nascent.

For example, The Roku Channel is available in the U.K. and it's available in Canada. But that's our overall strategy. And then I would say, thinking about AVOD, I mean, SVOD is fairly -- pay TV is popular in the United States, but in almost all international markets, AVOD is by far the dominant business model.

Free is very important worldwide.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. Your line is open.

Vasily Karasyov -- Cannonball Research -- Analyst

Thank you. So I've been hearing some concerns from investors about the press reports about Walmart selling TVs with Comcast operating system. So it does feel a little bit like the scare from last year with the Xfinity Flex. But I would appreciate your view on how this potentially can or cannot impact you.

And then I have one for Steve.

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Sure. This is Anthony. So we are the No. 1 TV OS in the United States and now in Canada, and we've achieved that position despite a very dynamic marketplace with intense competition from large tech companies and large TV companies as well.

And there's a few reasons we think we're successful or the most successful in the TV OS business. And one, of course, is just the Roku OS itself, our software. We've built a platform that's purpose-built for television. It's the best software platform for television.

It has lots of advantages for the entire ecosystem and for manufacturers, in particular. It allows them to build TVs that cost less. And so price -- it gives them a pricing advantage. So that's the big advantage, and we continue to refine that advantage.

But we do -- but so software, of course, is a big part of what we do. The other thing I would say is we have just world-class TV engineers. We have a great talent base. Those engineers come to work every day with the goal of making streaming better for our customers.

We're very focused and have a great engineering team. And then the Roku -- I would say, the Roku brand itself is a very strong brand. And for customers, it stands for streaming and great value. And so for those reasons and others, we've been very successful competing in the TV space.

It's a very competitive market. It's been competitive for a long time. But we're then No. 1 streaming OS, and I believe we're going to maintain that position.

In terms of Walmart, I'll just say a few words. I mean, Walmart is a big retailer, a very strong partner of Roku's. We have a great relationship with them. They sell millions of Roku players a year.

They sell millions of Roku TVs for various Roku OEMs, including TCL, Hisense, RCA, Philips, JVC. We build -- we help them build on branded, which is their house brand, Roku TVs, smart TVs. And that's a business that's been growing extremely well for them. So it's a great partnership, and it's a long-standing partnership, and we've put a lot of work into making sure that it stays strong.

Vasily Karasyov -- Cannonball Research -- Analyst

All right. Steve, I have a question about OneView revenue recognition. I think on the last quarter call, you said that you recognized at least the majority of it on a gross basis, and that had an impact on the margin in the quarter. And then you said that going forward, you will be recognizing an increasing proportion of it on a net basis.

So I was wondering if there was a change in impact from Q2 to Q3 from that on the margin and the platform segment.

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes. Vasily, yes, thanks for the question on that. Yes, you're right. I mean what I said was that the historical dataxu business there are effectively two parts, the kind of typical DSP business, which was net revenue treatment; and then a historical dataxu managed service business, which was on a gross revenue basis, and that as part of -- as Scott mentioned, rebranding and sort of integrating the operations to the OneView, we were shifting people over to new service agreements, and those were kind of net revenue treatment.

So that is an ongoing process. That wasn't a significant factor in the quarter. The increase -- or the expansion of the platform gross margin, both on a sequential and a year-over-year basis, was largely a result of just strong margins in both the advertising and content distribution business. So that trend will continue over time as we continue to shift more of the existing client base over to the new service agreements.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.

Steven Cahall -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Thanks. Just wanted to dive into the ad revenue a little bit. How do we think about the funnel for your ad buys between self-service, upfront deals and maybe buys through agencies that might be using their own DSPs? And I was wondering if at some point, you might look at restricting some of your high-value inventory to dataxu. And then could you give us some color as to how much your ad revenue is more like these brand marketing campaigns or upfront campaigns versus how much is more ad hoc reach extension? And how do you kind of convert somebody from a reach extension customer to something more strategic?

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Scott, do you want to take that?

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes, sure. Well, I guess, Steve, in answer to your question, we're here to sell how marketers want to buy. It's why we've got a media business and a DSP. It's why we also support third-party DSPs who want to be buying on the platform.

And it's really being able to participate in all those different ways of buying that allows us to keep expanding the segments that we serve in the ad market. We are strongest in all of those segments when a marketer comes to us and wants to take advantage of our deep first-party customer relationship, our identity, our data on users, our ability to optimize in a way that third-party ad tech cannot. And we can employ that value proposition, whether they're buying media from us, which, for example, many TV marketers do. They are IO, guaranteed Nielsen demo driven often when they first come to the platform, all the way through to programmatic buys transacted through OneView.

Our long-term view is that most TV advertising, this will take years to play out, is transacted programmatically. And referencing back to Laura Martin's question, that's why we made the move in acquiring dataxu, incorporating and relaunching OneView is so that we could enable marketers to leverage our unique assets or scale, regardless of how they're buying. So I hope that answers your question. I think maybe Steve wants to take the second part of your question on the -- more color on the revenue front.

Steve Louden -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes. It's Steve. In terms of revenue recognition, that's largely on the ad business related to when we run the ads. There can be some differences in the models themselves.

So there can be a bit of timing, but it's fairly straightforward. Was there a particular question within that?

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes. I'm sorry. Maybe I tossed it to you, Steve, and I think -- and Steve Cahall, maybe we need clarification. But I think your question was, how do they come to the platform? Is it -- are they starting from a reach extension strategy or some other case? I would say, what -- for TV marketers, their primary reason to come to Roku is the loss of reach within the linear pay TV ecosystem.

There are just -- whole classes of consumers that are simply no longer reachable through linear television ad buys. About half of TV time for adults 18 to 34 has moved to streaming. Those users are just not reachable anymore. So that's typically what brings a marketer into the Roku fold is the desire to keep reaching them on the big screen.

That said, with OneView, we have the ability, of course, to help them run an omnichannel campaign to reach a user first on the television and then retarget them off device. And we've also seen significant growth in the performance marketing, D2C segment of marketers who have social budgets. They are optimizing to a bottom-funnel outcome, a site visit an add to cart, a product purchase, a shopper data outcome. And those budgets come to us really from a different budget line at the client, and they're taking advantage of our deep data assets and ability to optimize those outcomes.

So I wouldn't call those TV dollars as much as performance marketing dollars. It's a significant growth segment for us.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet of Citi. Your line is open.

Jason Bazinet -- Citi -- Analyst

Thanks so much. The buy side is very focused on the pandemic sort of causing a big shift in streaming and digital ad dollars. And you guys referenced in your letter, some of the benefits you got as the linear TV ecosystem got gummed up with COVID. My question is, how do you think this plays out once the world goes back to normal? Do you think prudent investors should be sort of moderating their growth expectations sometimes next year? Or do you think the secular trends and all the steps you're taking will just allow you to power right through that without a deceleration?

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

This is Anthony. From my point of view, I think what we're seeing is a trend toward streaming that's been building for years now. And I think there's a lot of things that are causing it to accelerate and to continue to be a big trend, whether it's better customer value, more options, the ability to save money. There's just lots of content.

The content that's available on streaming has continued to build. And at this point, there's really nothing that you can't get by streaming. There's -- in fact, there's more content streaming than there is on traditional pay TV now. So I think the pandemic certainly helped accelerate that trend and maybe tipped over some things a little bit, but it's a trend that was happening anyway and will continue to happen for some time because everyone doesn't stream yet.

So I think we've seen strong growth. And it may moderate a little bit, but I think we're going to continue to see strong growth. I don't know. Scott, did you want to add anything to that?

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes. We're not going back to the way it was to be clear. I mean I think COVID triggered a lasting, durable change in how CMOs and marketers are thinking about their TV ad spend. We -- in Q3, we saw a 17% drop in linear viewing.

Roku was up 54%. 92% of Roku cord cutters are very satisfied with their decision to cut the cord and aren't planning to go back. So I really think this is a one-way transfer function. We don't go back to the older spending patterns because the audience isn't there.

Marketers need to follow the audience into OTT, and they stay because of the enhanced capabilities. So I think that's really what all this transition is helping teach marketers is that there's a better way. There's a more robust toolset in OTT. And we see it in our own stats, nearly 100% retention among the advertisers who spend over $1 million.

These budgets are not flowing back to television, traditional TV.

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

I mean, another proof point I got, I think, is just media companies, how they're increasingly reorganizing around streaming.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Rand with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.

Jeffrey Rand -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

Hi. Congrats on a good quarter. How are you guys thinking about advertisers' willingness to spend as the pandemic continues? And are you seeing certain industries still holding back on advertising spend?

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Scott, do you want to take that?

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes. I mean, certainly, there are some segments that are still slow to return. The ones you might expect, travel, quick-serve restaurants, things like that. But we saw a real strength in most other segments.

I mentioned CPG growing as quickly as it did. So I think that the big news here is just the shift, the realization that COVID has helped accelerate the need to reinvest in OTT. And of course, we're still early. Proportionate to viewership, we're nowhere close to capturing the kinds of budgets that are spent in television.

But the transition is very clear in the ultimate cause of the acceleration of spending in OTT.

Hi, guys. Maybe a 30,000-foot and a 5,000-foot question. On the higher end, where is the measurement discussion trending in your discussions with linear buyers today? Is there any tangible measurement solutions that are on the horizon that you see more linear buyers talking about and essentially, that's loosening -- would loosen the broader bottleneck? Obviously, you're seeing nice flow in linear today, but the broader bottleneck I'm talking about. And then a little more micro.

To what extent did political or its crowding out effect on nonpolitical spend, particularly in October, have on your pricing dynamics? And where is that trending now?

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Scott, that's another one.

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes. Let me take the measurement question in parts. So one of the reasons we invested and partnered with Nielsen years ago to enable demographic measurement in our platform is so we could provide marketers with a common currency across linear and OTT. So -- and we've continued to add to that capability the ability to measure reach and demographic holistically across linear and OTT.

We launched that capability years ago. We followed that with optimization using our data to target specifically cord cutters and people who are harder to reach in linear. This year, we followed it up with the -- with a guarantee that we would not charge marketers if we reached somebody who had already been reached in linear. So I think we've been the market leader in providing TV advertisers with a common currency and frankly, a bridge from linear television into OTT.

I think the really exciting stuff happens after marketers start to invest in OTT. OTT is a native digital platform that enables measurement up and down the funnel. It is an open IAB vast-based platform. And so this enables, on any given ad, multiple simultaneous kinds of measurement.

We're not headed toward a world where there's a single currency. Sometimes when people talk about measurement challenges in OTT, I think it's because they're harkening back to a day when there was one currency. We're not headed toward a world where there's one currency. There will be many.

And OTT will be all the more stronger for it because markets of all shapes and sizes will be able to pick and choose the currency that they care most about, which best fits their tactic. And then you asked a question about political ad spend. As I mentioned earlier, it was a meaningful and a relatively new category for us. We weren't particularly active during the last congressional or presidential cycle.

And so it's an area where we've put good energy into. And I think our platform offers powerful capabilities and was very attractive to political advertisers. That said, it wasn't a huge portion of our overall business. And so I didn't have a substantial effect on like overall pricing or other dynamics.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital. Your line is open.

Mark Mahaney -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Yeah. Sorry, I came in a little late. You may have already talked about it, so you can be brief. International, just give us an update on where you are in terms of rolling out both player and platform revenue, developing both player and platform revenue in international markets.

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Mark, this is Anthony. I'd be happy to talk about international. We did touch on it briefly, but just to summarize, streaming, obviously, is a large international opportunity and phenomena, and we're making good progress. And I'll just give you some examples.

We introduced players in Brazil, for example, following up from our TV launch several months ago in Brazil, which is off to a great start. We introduced the Streambar, which is a new two-in-one product that I'm super excited about. The Streambar basically is a streaming player that also makes the app sound better on your TV. And we launched that product in the U.S., but also in U.K., Canada and Mexico.

And so in certain markets like in the U.K., player sales doubled in the quarter, which was good progress. Canada, player sales doubled. And Roku TV, it's been No. 1 for a while in the U.S.

in terms of operating systems, smart TV operating system share. It's now No. 1 in Canada, so good progress there. Then I would say the strengths that have made us successful in the United States are working as we use them in other markets as well.

If you look at our quarterly results, 43% year-over-year active account growth, which was great, I mean, I thought that was incredible, given the size of the base that we have to go on. But that active account growth came domestically, but also, there were strong international contributions to that account growth as well. Our priority is to -- like I said, it's to focus on active accounts first, build scale and then start layering on monetization. So really, that is still, in most markets, scale is still our primary focus.

We are starting to -- we've got small ad teams in some markets, testing the market. We've launched The Roku Channel in a few markets like Canada and U.K., but the monetization really will follow, and we're focusing on scale first.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Greenfield with LightShed. Your line is open.

Richard Greenfield -- LightShed -- Analyst

Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I got two. One is really a big picture for Anthony.

You've seen this wave coming for many ways -- many years and have been predicting it. The challenge right now for big media companies, a lot of your partners is that sports is not only one of the key parts of that whole ecosystem, but it's also one of the biggest drivers of advertising. And I think a lot of these big media companies are struggling to figure out an economic model for sports to shift to streaming. I guess, do you have any advice? I mean there's so much money and so many ad dollars tied to sports, and it's sort of the last thing holding up the entire multichannel bundle.

How does sports -- how do they get sports into the streaming world? Should they bundle it into existing channels? Should they have true D2C sports streaming? Like how would you advise them as they think about sports? And then I've got a follow-up on The Roku Channel.

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Sure. Well, I mean, I think -- well, first of all, you can get sports in streaming. I mean it's still part of the bundle, like you said, you have to sign up for a virtual MVPD usually. I mean there's complicated deals, multiyear, 10-year deals in sports that I'm not really an expert in.

But if I could wave my hand, I would -- sure, I think the best thing for sports would be for them to start selling SVOD services like for regional sports networks as an SVOD service or the NFL as an SVOD service. I mean that's what -- that's, I think, the way consumers want to sign up and consume sports in a streaming world. That's how they sign up and see other streaming products on à-la-carte basis.

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes. Rich, I'll just add to Anthony's point. Yes, great question, and I don't think we have a short answer for it, but just a couple of stats that you might find interesting. January to September, so sort of bridging sports going away and coming back, heavy sports fans on the Roku platform dropped their linear viewing 26% and grew their streaming 17%.

So even as sports came back, the viewership didn't come back. Among heavy NFL viewers, we saw a 29% drop in linear and a 16% increase in streaming. So the disappearance of sports during COVID kind of accelerated the pressure on that vertical in the streaming. And the viewership, and I think ultimately, the dollars are not going to come back in the same way long term.

Richard Greenfield -- LightShed -- Analyst

That's exactly what we're seeing in terms of the impact on ratings, and that's why I feel like they have to figure it out. So I appreciate that answer. The other one, Scott, you've talked before about the fact that roughly three people per -- when we look at The Roku Channel numbers you released in terms of viewers, roughly three people per household is sort of the metrics so when you try to think about it relative to your active account base. So if I look at 54 million people who watch Roku Channel or reach Roku Channel, that's like 18 million households or roughly 40% almost of your base of Roku active accounts.

What do you need to do to get that base up from 40% to 75% or 80%, let alone 100%? Like, is it purely the content? Is it awareness of The Roku Channel? Like how do you bridge that gap?

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

I think Scott can add. But --

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Go ahead, Anthony.

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

I was just going to say like that's -- getting to a big number, like 100% penetration, is obviously our goal, and that's what we've been working on from the beginning. I mean, Roku Channel started out tiny, started out with 1,000 pieces of content, very small number of users. There's this virtuous cycle where we promote it, we onboard more content, we get more users, we get more advertisers, then we get more content, we do more promotion, we get bigger titles. And so that's going -- we're just going through that virtuous cycle, and it's getting bigger and bigger as a result.

It's the fastest-growing top 10 app on the Roku platform right now. So it's -- I'm confident we can get -- we can keep growing the Roku Channel. It's still pretty small compared to where it can be.

Richard Greenfield -- LightShed -- Analyst

And when you say top 10, Anthony, is that minutes watched or times used? Or what's the best way of thinking about that metric?

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Reach and hours.

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Yes, both.

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes, yes.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

Ben Swinburne -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Thank you. Good afternoon. I want to ask Scott about social budgets and whether you think you're taking share there. Some of your peers or competitors, this earnings cycle have talked about a shift in social spend onto other platforms that are viewed as more brand-safe.

And it would seem like that could be or is and could be a huge opportunity for Roku. So I'm just wondering if that benefited the quarter something that you're focused on even further kind of differentiating your platform versus some of those massive digital budgets out there. And then I wanted to ask Steve. Just on the guidance for Q4, if I'm doing the math right, I think you're guiding to platform revenue growth in the mid-50s or so.

Is that deceleration just because you don't have the sort of 606 impact that you had in 3Q? Just looking for any color there.

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Ben, I'll take the first part of your question. Yes, I mean I do fundamentally think that we are able to compete for social budget. So we don't always know which pocket the marketer is drawing the money from. But we have heard clearly that both because of exogenous factors, pricing pressure, what's going on in the social platforms as well as like maybe, more importantly, the fact that we have the capabilities to optimize to the outcomes that these marketers are focused on.

I mean TV has just never been able to compete there. And so that's why our performance marketing segment, while still early, is growing much faster than our overall ad business. And I think, by the way, that's one of the most interesting things about OTT advertising is it isn't just going to be a branding media or performance media, it's going to be both all at the same time. There really isn't an analog in any other media out there.

Linear TV is going to remain a top-funnel branding media. Social media is very much a bottom funnel. OTT has the opportunity to be both, and it just is going to make for a very rich ecosystem as well as the opportunity to tap into very, very large budgets, not just TV, but also digital.

Ben Swinburne -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

And Scott, just to follow up quickly on performance. How are you doing attribution? Is that something that you're able to tie back to mobile cross-platform to really connect the -- close the loop for advertisers in performance?

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes, it's a mix of both first party and third party. We have a wide array of third-party attribution partners. We have our own pixel, and so marketers can pick their preferred solution in OneView. We can automatically optimize to pixel placed on an advertiser's website according to the CPA, a performance target that a marketer provides to us.

Operator

And our last question comes from --

Steve Louden -- Chief Financial Officer

Hey, Ben --

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

There was a part two on that question, right?

Operator

I am sorry.

Steve Louden -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Sorry, operator, there's a second part to Ben's question there that I want to hit. Yes, Ben, so just on Q4, so just for the good of the order, we didn't provide any formal guidance. But in terms of some of the color we gave in terms of how we're thinking about how the quarter could look barring in any of these significant external factors that could impact the short term.

What I would say about the platform revenue is, certainly, we talked about how the content distribution deal revenue recognition can be lumpy quarter to quarter. The other factors that we talked about that are platform specific was specifically lapping the dataxu acquisition, which came into the results kind of mid-Q4 of last year as well as we're lapping some launches of new services from Q4 of last year.

Operator

Thank you. And our last question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. Your line is open.

Ruplu Bhattacharya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong quarter. Just two quick ones, if I can squeeze them in. Just one on The Roku Channel again.

So you've done a great job increasing the reach of the channel. Steve, if you can just talk about how the ad load is trending on the channel. Are you happy with that load as it is today? Is there room for growth? And can you address the CPM? Do you think you can maintain the CPM? And some investors think that over time, that has to go down, but just your thoughts on that. And the second question is just on international expansion.

You've done a great job in the U.S. You've got great distribution relationships. When we look at internationally, that's a more fragmented market. So are you having to hire more people on the ground who have these relationships? And then in that vein, how should we think about opex going forward?

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

So I think the first question was actually for Scott on TRC and ad loads and CPM.

Scott Rosenberg -- Senior Vice President, General Manager, Platform Business

Yes. I'll take that first question. We're quite happy with our recipe of half the load of linear television. We think it strikes the right balance between a great consumer experience while also providing strong monetization opportunities.

So we're not planning to tinker with that. I think there's lots of upside potential in terms of how valuable we make that inventory as well as opportunities beyond 15- and 30-second spots. We've done some work in the market with pause ads and other ad units. So I think it's a great consumer experience as delivered today.

Regarding your question about CPMs, OTT is just a better, higher-performance product. And so I think it does reasonably command higher CPMs relative to, say, linear television. That said, I don't think -- going back to the prior question, I don't think there's long-term one-single CPM to rule them all. In long run, in OTT, lots of different marketers, top to bottom of the funnel come into the ecosystem and compete in a common auction for ad inventory.

And just like you see in social media platforms, you don't end up with a singular CPM across all users and all content. That's one of the things I think is most interesting long term about the OTT media. There was a second part to the question, I think, Anthony would take it.

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. I can take the international question. So first of all, I'll just reiterate that we're making good progress internationally. And yes, it is a fragmented -- more fragmented market because -- and I would say in big part because Roku was not into those countries yet.

And so as we've entered countries and brought the full portfolio of our assets, we're gaining market share and consolidating a lot of the market around Roku. So for example, Canada, I mean, a small country, but it was the first one we went into after the U.S., and now we're No. 1 for TVs, and our player market share is very high. We have an ad sales team there.

So it's starting to look a lot like the U.S. for us. But our -- in terms of investment, international is one of our key strategic investment areas that we view. Obviously, it takes people to do it well.

The way we focus is we pick our focus countries, which we keep expanding. And then we make sure that we have local content. So we hire local people to do local content deals. We make sure we have local retailer relationships, getting into local channels, local distribution channels.

We bring Roku TV to market, which requires a lot of localization. But also in many cases, specific features that are regulated or required by the government, so we add those. We bring our players to market. We bring our audio for TV products to market, so we bring the whole portfolio of products and offer just a very complete and compelling solution.

And that's -- and then our market share starts to grow. So that's what we're doing. It's working well.

Operator

Thank you. And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Anthony Wood for any closing comments.

Anthony Wood -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, operator. I'd like to close by reiterating how pleased we are with this quarter's results and wrap up with two concluding points. First, reaching 46 million active accounts at 43% year-over-year growth rate shows Roku's momentum. It reveals Roku's scale relative to traditional pay TV providers who have continued to lose subscribers during the quarter.

The pandemic is accelerating the shift away from traditional pay TV. I'm confident that the shift to streaming will be permanent for the vast majority of consumers. Second, the strength of our financial results illustrates the leverage of our business model. The leverage of our business model may deliver over longer term as we continue to execute our strategic plan.

I hope you and your families stay safe and enjoy the upcoming holidays. Thanks again for joining the call, and happy streaming.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Caesars Entertainment, Inc. 2020 third-quarter earnings call. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Brian Agnew, senior vice president of finance, investor relations, and treasury.

Brian Agnew -- Senior Vice President of Finance, Investor Relations, and Treasury

Well, thank you, Ashley, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Welcome to our conference call to discuss our third-quarter 2020 earnings. This afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our third-quarter financial results for the period ended September 30, 2020. The A copy of the press release is available on the investor relations section of our website at investor.caesars.com.

Joining me on the call today are Tom Reeg, our chief executive officer; Anthony Carano, our president and chief operating officer; and Bret Yunker, our chief financial officer. Before I turn the call over to Tom, I would like to remind you that during today's conference call, we may make certain forward-looking statements about the company's performance. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and, therefore, one should not place undue reliance on them. Forward-looking statements are also subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed.

For additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from those discussed in our forward-looking statements, you should refer to the cautionary statements contained in our press release, as well as the risk factors contained in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Caesars Entertainment undertakes no obligations to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after today's call. Also during today's call, the company may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed, and the reconciliation of these differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and then the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company's website at investor.caesars.com, by selecting the press release regarding the company's 2020 third-quarter financial results.

I will now turn the call over to Tom.

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everybody. We're back to report our third-quarter earnings. As you look at our income statement, keep in mind that Eldorado Resorts was the surviving entity in the transaction.

We changed our name to Caesars Entertainment. So, there's a lot of noise in the financial statements you're looking at 2019 numbers that are legacy Eldorado. You're looking at 2020 numbers that are legacy Eldorado only through July 20, and then the combined company through the end of the quarter. We're going to cut through and get you to what we think are the key points in the quarter.

Our same-store adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was a little over $460 million which was a little ahead of the wide end of the range of our pre-release during our equity offering. We're quite pleased with the progress that we've made since closing the transaction. We've seen quite a bit of opportunity within Caesars. Some was expected, some were nice surprises.

We continue to believe that we will bring the consolidated EBITDA margin in a post-COVID world at least to the mid- to high-30s, if not 40% EBITDA margin in the consolidated entity. Vegas, Anthony will get into detail, but we did $60 million of EBITDA in Vegas. And keep in mind that was with dragging Rio and Cromwell and Planet Hollywood were closed for the whole quarter. Planet Hollywood and Rio have opened since Bally's was also close for part of the quarter.

So, we are carrying operating losses relative to those assets to get to that $60 million number. Our occupancy for the quarter in Las Vegas was just under 60%, just few basis points under 60%. We're running in the mid-50s on weekdays now and weekends were well into the mid- to high-90s. So, we've been heartened by our performance.

Clearly, that's a key piece of evidence on the strength of the Caesars rewards program. Pavan Kapur at Caesars, who we inherited on the yield management side, is a wizard with this stuff and has done a tremendous job for us in Vegas, and we've moved him throughout the company in this area. So, we're excited with what Pavan and his group will bring to the table for us. As I said, the merger closed on July 20.

So, obviously, that was during the quarter. Also, we announced a cash offer to acquire William Hill during the quarter for 272p per share. That shareholder vote will take place on November 19 as is -- as needs to be the case under U.K. takeover code.

We cash confirmed the entire amount for that transaction, including an equity offering that was just shy of $2 billion on October 1 of this year. We entered -- we expanded our relationship with ESPN in the quarter on the sports betting side, which we think is an exciting piece for customer acquisition for us. We've got a co-exclusive link out across all ESPN channels with DraftKings, and we're excited with what that will bring to the table. We were also active on the asset sale front, we closed the sale -- or we announced the sale, I'm sorry, of Tropicana Evansville for 480 million to Twin River and GLPI just about a week ago.

You should expect to see more news in Indiana prior to the end of the year from us. And I would say a couple of things that I'd stress as takeaways and questions that I get. On the operating side of the business, if you annualize the costs that are out of the business this quarter, excluding gaming taxes, which obviously reduce that as gaming revenue goes down, our run rate cost reduction is about $2 billion from pre-COVID levels. There's obviously a lot of talk about what will come back, what won't come back.

A lot of those costs are never coming back, as I said. Over the last several quarters, none of that has changed. As I said, I think we're going to get to 35 to 40% EBITDA margins at a minimum. It's enjoyable from my seat to see our peers in the space reporting the same types of cost savings opportunities that we've been talking about for many years and to see Las Vegas locals margins in excess of 40% for the quarter at a couple of our peers.

That's a road map to what's coming. You think about what revenue is missing from our business. It's the highest flow-through revenue in the business. It's hotel room rate and occupancy in Las Vegas.

And what I -- I told you two quarters ago, prior to the reopenings that you were going to be surprised with what regionals could do on the margin side. And we had another quarter where if you look at our peer regionals without destination properties, EBITDA was up substantially. Anthony will get into that. What I'd tell you today is when we get into a post-COVID world, the pent-up demand you're going to see for gaming in general and Las Vegas, in particular, is going to be beyond your wildest dreams.

And the flow-through that you're going to see in the sector is unlike anything that's happened historically in this space. And so, I can't tell you when is that going to happen. I can't -- I wish I could answer when the public health situation will change. But as we look at the pieces of our database that are missing or lagging, they're the most profitable pieces of our database.

It's the 55 and over cohort that's not coming. These are people that are not going anywhere and are not spending and are going to come out of this with significant pent-up demand and spending power. And it's going to be extremely powerful what you'll see, I think, across the entertainment space, but particularly in casinos and particularly in Las Vegas. The other question I get all the time is about sports and online.

And I'd tell you, our New Jersey casino business continues to ramp up even after physical properties reopen. We're now on a run rate for $150 million of annual revenue out of the iGaming business in New Jersey at margins in the mid-30s. So, we're extremely excited about that business. We think controlling our destiny in this space positions us to be a long-term winner.

The ability to wrap our iGaming and our iCasino into a single wallet, attached to your Caesars reward database with the ability to earn and use points in any way that you'd like, online or offline. Our customers truly get an immersive experience in this company. And you see it with what we're doing in Vegas. We think that's going to translate into the online business.

And I don't really have a road map to what the ultimate size of business this will be, but I do know that if you're betting against the American people's propensity to gamble or you're betting against the lower four states to attract tax revenue when their budgets are in the place that they are today, that's been a losing bet since the dawn of civilization. So, I feel real good about where we are, where we're headed, and I'll turn it over to Anthony.

Anthony Carano -- President and Chief Operating Officer

Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. I'd like to take a few minutes to provide you with some operational highlights for our portfolio during the third quarter. Before I begin, I want to express my sincere gratitude to all of our team members for their hard work and dedication during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our operations performed extremely well during these trying times due to the outstanding service that our guests receive on a daily basis from all of our great team members.

Our success this quarter is a clear reflection of the commitment our team members who continue to work hard each day to provide a safe, healthy and exciting environment for our guests and their fellow team members. Now turning to operations. We now have 55 of our 56 properties reopened. As we mentioned in our press release, our regional properties are performing strongly.

Within our regional segment and excluding destination markets like Atlantic City, Reno, New Orleans and Tahoe, our regional properties generated a revenue decline of 11% and EBITDA growth of 10%, leading to over 700 basis points of margin expansion, 10 properties had margin growth of over 1,000 basis points. In total, and including the destination markets in our regional portfolio, regional EBITDA for the third quarter was $447 million. Now, turning to Las Vegas and our regional destination markets. Starting with Las Vegas, we now have every property open, except the Rio.

We generated $60 million of adjusted EBITDA in Las Vegas in the quarter with operating performance improving each month throughout the quarter, leading to a strong month of September. We continue to see strong occupancy trends on the weekends, in excess of 90% with mid-week occupancy still running in the 50 to 60% range. We were encouraged when Governor Sisolak lifted the meeting caps from 50 to 250 people, which has allowed us to host some small group meetings in Q4. Excluding the closed properties during the quarter, property level EBITDA was approximately $100 million.

Our destination markets in the regional portfolio displayed sequential improvement in operating performance throughout the quarter, leading to September showing the displayed sequential improvement in operating performance throughout the quarter, leading to September showing material improvement in the rate of EBITDA decline versus July and August. These regional destination properties with large hotel room portfolios are slowly recovering as operations return to normal and customers are returning to the properties. Overall, our immediate actions to reduce operating expenses at our reopened properties contributed to a leaner cost structure that we believe will contribute to sustainable EBITDA margin expansion. We are encouraged by the performance of the regional markets and the sequential rate of change in property performance within our destination markets during the quarter.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bret for some additional insights on the third quarter and details on our balance sheet and capital structure. Bret?

Bret Yunker -- Chief Financial Officer

Great. Thanks, Anthony. As everyone on the call is aware, we had quite an active third quarter even by our own standards. We closed on the Caesars merger on July 20 and subsequently announced the proposed transaction to acquire William Hill plc on September 30.

As we mentioned in the press release, our quarter ending balance sheet was impacted by the cash required to be placed in escrow for William Hill in connection with the Rule 2.7 announcement. On October 1, we completed a public equity offering of 35.6 million shares, generating net proceeds of $1.95 billion. Additionally, in early October, we entered into a GBP 1.5 billion interim facilities agreement with two large international banks. Execution of this committed debt financing allowed us to release 2 billion of cash that have been escrowed on September 30, allowing us to fully repay a 900 million draw on our parent revolver and return excess cash liquidity to our balance sheet.

As of today, both of our revolvers are undrawn, and our unrestricted cash position is over $2 billion. Based on current operating trends, we expect to end the year with a similar level of cash on hand and zero revolver balances. As I mentioned on our second-quarter call, our approach to maintenance and growth capital investment will be focused and disciplined. Over the next 12 months, we expect to spend approximately 300 to $350 million on capex, excluding any Atlantic City-specific capex that's already been escrowed.

With that, I'll turn it back to Tom.

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Bret. Let me give you -- before we go to questions, let me add a few comments on cadence of business since the quarter. Sequentially, it continues to get stronger. October was better than September.

September was better than August. If you think about what that looks like in Las Vegas, I'm going to give you some numbers that I'm not -- we're not in the habit of giving you, but given the cloudiness of business, as you look at the COVID world, I think it's useful. If you look at EBITDAR by month for us in Las Vegas, July was $10 million positive, and these are aggregate numbers, so include the losses from properties that were shut down. So, 10 in July, 16 million in August, 34 million in September, and October should push 50 million.

We've got preliminary numbers, we've not closed the month yet. So, Vegas continues to get better for us. We're not going to be talking about shutting properties midweek. Obviously, we're talking about opening additional properties.

We opened Cromwell last week. I'd expect to see Rio open before the end of the year. On the group side, the second half of '21 and beyond have record business on our books. Q2 to Q4 '21 are well ahead of our 2019 pace and bookings were strong in the third quarter, basically a normal level of bookings.

If you look at the Caesars Forum convention center, which was opened for about a day and a half before everything shut down from COVID, Caesars Forum has 172 events, 1.6 million room nights, contracted worth over $600 million in rooms and banquet revenue and 78% of that business is new to Las Vegas. And what I tell you is none of that matters if the public health situation does not improve, but we are heartened by Governor Sisolak's recent movement toward socially distance meeting business and his statement that he's looking to go to 50% capacity by the beginning of 2021. That should help us save some first half 2021 business. But first quarter, you should expect we'll look very much like the last three quarter -- the second quarter, third quarter of '20 and this quarter as well.

And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.

Questions & Answers:

Operator

[Operator instructions] And your first question comes from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel.

Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst

Hey, guys. So, Tom, I want to start in Vegas. And if you look at this point, you said your occupancies are running above 90% on the weekends, mid-50s weekdays. Is there any way to kind of think about that weekend kind of traffic, how much of that business in terms of the mid-90s is kind of a cash business versus whether that's a comp business or a reward redemption?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

So you should presume that if you look at our historical mix, Steve, that the convention business has been replaced by casino block business, and that the other segments remain relatively constant as you look back.

Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst

OK. Got you. And then, the comments you made about demand is going to be, I think you said beyond either my wildest dreams or your wildest dreams. Was that mostly related to Vegas? Is that kind of across the entire across the entire U.S.?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

It's across the entire U.S. When I tell you that our 55 and over group is significantly lagging the rest of the business that's throughout the country. And those are the people that tend to skew to older population that are not leaving their houses right now. My mother is one of those.

And when you get a vaccine and you have freedom of movement and feel better in terms of the likelihood of contracting COVID, I think that the pent-up demand for Vegas and for entertainment generally is well beyond what anyone is thinking today.

Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst

And have you seen any change in that 55 and over kind of crowd recently?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Everything is kind of grinding a little bit better every month, month over month, but it's baby steps.

Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst

OK. And then, last question. So, with William Hill, and I'm not sure how much you can say given the pending -- the deal hasn't closed yet. But let's say that deal does go through and you talked about that single app.

Do you have any idea yet in terms of when that single app would be deployed?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

I'm extremely limited in what I can speak to on William Hill outside of the four corners of the document. You can presume that we were already working in that direction in the former iteration and we would continue to work in that direction post-closing.

Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst

Great. Thanks, Tom.

Operator

Your next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.

Thomas Allen -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Hey, how are you? So it's now been about three and a half months since you bought Caesars. Can you talk a little bit about additional synergy opportunities you've found that you've kind of been under the hood for a bit longer?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. I mean, so the whole synergy discussion, as we talked about, was turned on its head by COVID. It's really a question of what comes back rather than what you subtract. But Caesars ran differently than Eldorado just from a basic day-to-day operation standpoint.

We run our properties off of daily P&Ls across every property that we own. Caesars measurement of EBITDA was far less frequent than that. And there wasn't a lot -- the operators didn't really have the tools to compare themselves across properties within the system. So when we were Eldorado as a private company and we were in two markets, we could look at those two markets and say, what are we doing well in one versus the other.

When you've got 55, that ability becomes much, much stronger. That's a benefit of scale. And Caesars was not taking advantage of that in our estimation. And you can imagine that we are -- it took us the better part of two months to get to a daily P&L, and we're still working through the kinks in the Caesars system, but we just went through our first round of quarterly reviews, and it's eye opening for the operators to see when I'm looking at each line item, each department and versus others in my market or other similar properties, things that I was unaware that I was inefficient in become obvious.

And that sort of block -- basic blocking and tackling is what we're working through now. And that's why I tell you I have an extreme level of confidence in hitting our margin targets here.

Thomas Allen -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

That's helpful. And then, just on the sports I mean iGaming, any updated thoughts around branding?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

You should expect that we will use the Caesars brand for Caesars operated -- owned and operated properties. And for third-party properties, you should expect that the William Hill brand will live on in the U.S.

Thomas Allen -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Thank you. Make sense.

Operator

Your next question comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research.

Jared Shojaian -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Tom, you talked about October Vegas pushing 50 million in EBITDA. I know there's weird seasonality with Vegas right now in the fourth quarter without the group business and the convention business.

Can you just help us think about November and December? Obviously, I know it's dependent on a lot like New Year's Eve and other holidays, but how should we think about those two months? Are you assuming that sequential step-up you've been seeing pretty consistently can continue, or is there some other factors to consider there?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

No. As you know, you're hitting a normal soft period in Vegas that November and then pre-December -- or pre-Christmas December, but what we're seeing is the reduction in volumes is not nearly what it's been historically, at least in our business. So, we feel good about posting a strong fourth quarter number in Las Vegas.

Jared Shojaian -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

OK. And then, I'll try to tackle this question a little differently. But if I think back to your most recent synergy target, the 800 million cost savings, the 100 million of revenue synergies, should we assume the entire$800 million of opportunity is already in that 2 billion number of costs that have been taken out? So really, it's entirely just a matter of getting the revenue back, or are there still some additional costs you think you could take out and then presumably, the 100 million of revenue synergies is still outstanding. Is it fair to say you really haven't gotten any of that yet?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. The revenue synergies, yes, absolutely. On the cost side, the one piece that came through COVID relatively unscathed on the Caesars side was corporate. You can see in our numbers that we cut about 200 million from -- on an annualized basis from corporate, and that's what we expected to do.

And you can see that that's complete. You should presume the rest of the cost savings are included in those numbers. But if you think about, we had an $800 million target between cost and revenue, 100 million was revenue. So, 700 million of costs, they did about 11 billion -- the combined company is about 11 billion of revenue at, let's call it, a 28% margin for 2019.

And so, if we were to get to our 35% left side of the range that I've been talking about, that's almost 800 million of just cost savings. And obviously, if we get to 40%, there is more than that.

Jared Shojaian -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

OK. Great. And maybe just to quickly follow up on that. I think you're divesting a lot more properties than you had initially expected when you announced the deal, is that positive, negative or neutral to the margin?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

It depends on the properties, I would say, of the properties that we've sold and that we're anticipating selling all of those would be -- removing them from the equation would be accretive to that overall margin target.

Jared Shojaian -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

OK. Great. Thank you very much for the time.

Operator

Your next question comes from John DeCree with Union Gaming.

John DeCree -- Union Gaming -- Analyst

Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Tom, Bret, I wanted to ask you guys a little bit about deleveraging from here and the capital that you raised this quarter earmarked for William Hill. You talked in the past about at some point, selling a strip asset just to help delever more quickly.

But based on what you see now and the amount of costs that have come out of the business and your kind of outlook for margin, how do you approach deleveraging from here? Is it going to be through EBITDA growth? I mean you have some asset sales that you just talked about will help. But just curious to get your thoughts on the cadence over the next 12 or 18 months, ways that you'll work down leverage.

Bret Yunker -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, it's really going to be a combination of all of the above. Again, we're hopeful that we're nearing an inflection point here where we start generating strong free cash flow post this health crisis. So, that's obviously No. 1.

Alongside that, we've been announcing asset sales, and we expect to continue announcing them going forward. So, that will be part of the package. And Las Vegas, we want to get past the health crisis and then think about monetizing an asset here. So, all three of those alongside the denominator growing sequentially is going to help us deleverage in the next 12 to 24 months.

John DeCree -- Union Gaming -- Analyst

And Tom, on the sports and iCasino strategy, assuming the transaction with William Hill proceeds, and you look at your portfolio of brands and assets, do you see any need or opportunity to add additional, either services or brands or partners for that portfolio? You've got a big one with ESPN. Is there still more to do as you continue to build out business?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

This is all about building market share profitably and making your customers as sticky as possible. And so, we think we have the building blocks to do that with what we'll have post the William Hill transaction, but we'll always be looking to improve upon that. And I've found it interesting to see non-gaming entities look into this space, just the IAC moving into MGM, obviously, what ESPN did with us and DraftKings. Obviously, there are a lot of companies out there who are looking for share of wallet and screen time on your phone.

So, it wouldn't surprise me if you see more of that as we move into the future. And If there were a partnership or a transaction that would improve our position then we could execute it in a manner that was -- that created additional value for our stakeholders, we would certainly take a serious look.

John DeCree -- Union Gaming -- Analyst

Very good. Thanks for the questions guys.

Operator

Your next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie.

Chad Beynon -- Macquarie Research -- Analyst

Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question, guys. I wanted to drill into the regional gaming EBITDA 444 million or, I guess, maybe more importantly, the 33% margin. You noted that it was hamstrung by some of these regional, I guess, destination properties and Lake Charles being closed. I was wondering if you are willing to, I guess, help us think about what the drag was, or if these properties had been punching at the same level as the other assets, what the result would have been? Any more color just on kind of the impact there and how to think about that going forward?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

So you've got New Jersey, Reno and New Orleans that are your biggest drags, obviously, like Charles this quarter, given the storm. But in the -- in terms of materiality, the three are in Atlantic City, Reno, New Orleans. Atlantic City opened very beginning of the quarter. You had no alcohol service, you had no food service and significant limitations on capacity that lasted for a significant period of time during your peak season in Atlantic City.

So, Atlantic City comps obviously look poor. In Reno, we had the Silver Legacy tower open. We had a fair amount of Eldorado rooms open. We did not have the Circus Circus 1,600 rooms opened at all, again, in the seasonal peak for the market.

And then New Orleans, New Orleans is a significant national database receiver of business. People not traveling New Orleans as a market as their restrictions are stricter than the state itself. You have legislative-mandated labor count in New Orleans and you have a tax system where we paid a fixed rate in the quarter versus the variable rate that we typically pay. So those three properties are significant drags as we move into fourth quarter and you get into the shoulder season, Reno and Atlantic City look a lot better because you're doing pretty well on a comp basis midweek in those markets when properties weren't full this time last year and the weekend drop-off is not nearly what it was in the summer.

New Orleans still has all of the same issues that it had in the third quarter.

Chad Beynon -- Macquarie Research -- Analyst

Great. Really helpful. And then, Bret, just on the cash flow side, could you just remind us in terms of what the annual or quarterly cash interest and cash rent will be? A little bit of noise in the reporting here, but that would be helpful.

Bret Yunker -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, putting GAAP aside, on a pure cash basis, we're roughly $2 billion all-in of annual master lease, rent payments and interest expense, so you can just divide that by four for the quarters.

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

About 1.2 billion of rent and 800 million of interest.

Chad Beynon -- Macquarie Research -- Analyst

Thank you, guys.

Your next question comes from Dan Politzer with JP Morgan.

Dan Politzer -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst

Afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping that you could give maybe an update on your iGaming rollout and when we could expect to see your launch in Pennsylvania, more formally at least? And maybe if there's any plans for Michigan and if you have a market access agreement there?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, on Michigan, an intention to roll out there, Pennsylvania, I don't know --

Anthony Carano -- President and Chief Operating Officer

Yeah. We're live in Pennsylvania, Dan, right now. We're rolling out more product and more games as every day and week passes. So, we're expecting to see incremental opportunities in 2021 as these new products are rolled out.

So, we would be optimistic on growth in Pennsylvania in 2021. Also in the state of New Jersey, we're going to be launching live dealer on the Caesars side for iGaming. So, that's an exciting opportunity as well.

Dan Politzer -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst

Got it. And then, in Virginia, there was recently passed legislation that legalized gaming in Danville, where you talked about building a casino. Could you maybe talk to us about -- a little bit about the project, potential cost and return, the competitive environment there and how you're thinking about this at a high level?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. So, the project that was approved, we'd expect 20% returns on roughly a $400 million investment. Keep in mind, as you look at that project, that's in the radius of the Cherokee property that we operate in North Carolina and the Tribe has the opportunity and the option to opt in up to 80% of the equity of the Danville property, and that became available to them upon the passage of the vote on Tuesday. So, it's too early to say where that will eventually head.

Dan Politzer -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst

Got it. Thanks so much guys. Appreciate it.

Operator

Your next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies.

David Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Hi. Afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the WH acquisition and essentially why now and the degree to which you get close on it, what kind of tech investment and/or marketing spend you envision might be required to be a leader with it or could be successful with it?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. So, as we looked at the opportunity in the space, as I've said, I think this is the most significant growth opportunity in the casino space since riverboats were legalized in the '90s. We were looking at the partnership that we brought in from the Eldorado side where if you recall, we entered that partnership knowing that Eldorado's brand was unlikely to play on a national basis. We wanted to form a partnership with a respected sports betting operator that had a national strategy where we could participate in the upside.

We subsequently bought Caesars who obviously has a very different brand situation than Eldorado, and it became clear that we have a brand that can resonate on a national level. We've got a database that can feed into that business. And we had been talking about how should we proceed with the partnership. If you recall, the partnership included sports betting and not -- include sports betting and not Internet casino.

If you're going to get to a single wallet solution, you need both. So, it really wasn't ideal for either partner in the current landscape. So, as we looked at potential solutions, it became clear to us that the best answer for us was to control our own destiny here. And so, we started discussions about a purchase and ended up where you saw us end up.

On the marketing question, yes, the combined company here, the combined pro forma entity, iGaming and sports, does about $100 million -- will do about $100 million in EBITDA, positive EBITDA, not the 200, 300 million of negative EBITDA that you're accustomed to in the space, it will do $100 million of positive EBITDA. That includes all of the marketing that we're doing now. So, if you see us ramp up marketing, it's from an EBITDA positive position. In terms of the tech spend, William Hill has been spending a significant amount of capital developing its Liberty platform that rolled out in New Jersey to strong reviews.

They're in the process of continuing to roll that out throughout the U.S. You're never going to stop spending on tech, but I don't see a significant material tech spend that's -- you should be plugging into your model that's going to be a giant sort of cash. You should be thinking of 10, $20 million a year neighborhood.

David Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst

OK. And I recall, I hope I have your terminology correct, but the notion that iGaming and sports betting may warrant its own brain at some point. How have you thought about making sure that that business can grow and achieve what it needs to achieve under your roof versus its own roof?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

So it will be an unrestricted sub of Caesars Entertainment upon closing. Post the Caesars acquisition, Eric Hession and Chris Holdren, out of the Caesars side, agreed to stay as co-Presidents of that business for us. Christian Stuart, on the operations side, has been invaluable in this process for us, will remain involved. So you will see it as it will operate as a subsidiary of its own, you will be able to see the numbers of it on its own, then the question becomes what's the best structure from a capital markets perspective.

And we have time to make those decisions. The expectation at the outset is it will be a wholly owned unrestricted sub of Caesars Entertainment, will not have its own currency. But as you know, we are 100% focused on driving value to our shareholders. And if the right answer is it becomes a separate entity with its own currency, you might see us head in that direction in the future.

David Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Great. Thank you so much.

Operator

Your next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist Securities.

Barry Jonas -- Truist Securities -- Analyst

Hey, guys. I wanted to start with Vegas. Can you maybe just talk about the reintroduction of entertainment? How profitable do you think that can be either directly or indirectly? And then also, what's been the response so far to the return of paid parking?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. So, on the question of entertainment, we're absolutely thrilled that we've seen movement in that area and the ability to operate what our some fairly small venue entertainment across the city, what you're seeing come back, you're not seeing headline entertainment come back. You're not seeing big production shows come back. What you're seeing are the 500, 600 seats that are now offering 100, 200 seats.

It's not a hugely profitable business on its own, but it creates additional reason to visit the market, and that's important to us. Every piece that we get that becomes another reason for someone to make the move to either drive here or fly here and stay in the market is good for the whole market. So, we're extremely pleased that we're able to offer entertainment today. The initial response has been extremely strong, and we're happy to have it back.

Now, the issue of parking, you got a heavy drive-in business now. As I said, we're mid-90 to high 90s occupancy on the weekends as you -- and you know that we have kind of 50-yard line real estate on the strip. So, what we were finding was our best customers were having difficulty finding parking in our garages even if they had a lodging reservation. And so, what we wanted to do was to bring back parking -- to bring back parking fees as kind of a hurdle so that our best customers can get to the property.

If you are a significant Caesars reward customer, you're a lodger or you're a local, you're not paying for parking. And to drive home the point that this was for those purposes and because of the situation that we've seen in Nevada, as we implemented, we said we're going to donate all of our profits from parking for this quarter and next to local charities that support the community and those that have been displaced by COVID. So, the response has been overwhelmingly positive from the city and from our customers.

Barry Jonas -- Truist Securities -- Analyst

That's great. And then, just a follow-up. How are you thinking about, I guess, OpCo mix to the business now? Tom, in the past, you've talked about sort of like a 50-50 mix. Is that still the goal once the dust settles?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. You shouldn't see us doing sale-leaseback transactions of -- or sales of real estate that will skew that. As you've seen us in the past, we've utilized the prop co market for financing typically for transactions. So, were there something to come up that made sense, it could be a tool that's used, but I don't expect us to be particularly acquisitive from here, so you shouldn't see much movement on the real estate side.

Barry Jonas -- Truist Securities -- Analyst

Great. Thanks so much.

Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.

Shaun Kelley -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Two questions. Just wanted to go back to the sort of regional margin performance. If we look at the kind of the numbers on a quarter basis, talking about those 700 basis points, is it fair just as we think about continued recognition of some of the synergies in some of your initiatives that 700 basis points could actually improve or accelerate from here, or do you think this is a good reflection of what the ability of the business can be when everything else starts to settle in?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

You should expect that it can continue to grow because, as I talked about earlier, what's missing from the business is some of your highest flow-through revenue. So, as that starts to come back into these markets, and I'm thinking particularly of Atlantic City, Reno and New Orleans, flow-through is quite high. And their contribution to the total regional pie in a post-COVID world should drive the entire regional sector margin higher.

Shaun Kelley -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

That's really helpful, Tom. And then, sort of a separate but big picture strategic question. So, there's been some discussion as it relates to William Hill and I guess the bigger kind of picture strategy here as it relates to this kind of single wallet or access to the customer probably via an app. And I'm just kind of curious like Caesars always took a pretty centralized or increasingly moved to a centralized marketing approach.

Tom, at Eldorado, I think without mischaracterizing, you guys were always pretty focused on a decentralized approach to really accessing the customers, empowering some of the local property managers. How do you think about that in the digital realm? So just sort of how do you kind of like connect all this together as it relates to software and one vision of the customer? Does it sort of need to be centralized, or can you balance those two approaches? And how would you sort of go about doing it, or does anything need to change?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

I think you should think about it as to how we operate the entire business. What will differentiate us in this space is the stickiness of our customers, the immersion in our network. If you think about -- I know you're -- in the free COVID world, you'd be a frequent traveler like I was. Think of the gymnastics you would go through to make sure that you're flying on your favorite airline or you're staying in your hotel where you've got the most points.

That's what we've got in the Caesars rewards system, and it's a much broader relationship than just how much money did I give you to place your sports bet on my app. It's a much stickier customer. So, you shouldn't think of the sports betting marketing is going to be materially different than the way that we built the business on the bricks-and-mortar side. I understand there's this race for market share and handle and all the numbers that come out monthly right now.

This is a long game. I go back to my riverboat example. I remember calling on names like Casino Magic and Casino America and Players International Argosy Gaming, all of those ultimately went away and got consolidated into the leaders in the business. That's where we're going to end up.

You are in inning one of if you're thinking in baseball terms, what ultimately will be an extra inning game. And we're assembling the building blocks to be a winner here long term to attract as much market share as we can over time profitably, but make sure that it's sticky. I can make my market share in any individual market, look the way that I wanted to look to report to you at the end of the month if I throw enough money at it. That's not how we do business.

That's not how you should expect us to tackle this area.

Shaun Kelley -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Caesars Entertainment Inc. 2020 Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Brian Agnew, Senior Vice President of Finance, Investor Relations and Treasury.

Brian Agnew -- Investor Relations

Well, thank you, Ashley, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Welcome to our conference call to discuss our third quarter 2020 earnings. This afternoon we issued a press release announcing our third quarter financial results for the period ended September 30, 2020. A copy of the press release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.caesars.com.

Joining me on the call today are Tom Reeg, our Chief Executive Officer; Anthony Carano, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bret Yunker, our Chief Financial Officer.

Before I turn the call over to Tom, I would like to remind you that during today's conference call we may make certain forward-looking statements about the company's performance.

I will now turn the call over to Tom.

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon everybody. We're back to report our third quarter earnings. As you look at our income statement, keep in mind that Eldorado Resorts was the surviving entity in the transaction, we changed our name to Caesars Entertainment. So there is a lot of noise in the financial statements you're looking at 2019 numbers that our Legacy Eldorado, you are looking at 2020 numbers that are Legacy Eldorado only through July 20 and then the combined company through the end of the quarter. We're going to cut through and get you to what we think are the key points in the quarter.

Our same-store adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was a little over $460 million, which was a little ahead of the wide end of the range of our pre-release during our equity offering. We're quite pleased with the progress that we've made since closing the transaction. We've seen quite a bit of opportunity within Caesars, some was expected, some were, were nice surprises, we continue to believe that we will bring the consolidated EBITDA margin in a post-COVID world at least to the mid to high 30s, if not 40% EBITDA margin in the consolidated entity.

Vegas, Anthony will get into detail, but we did $60 million of EBITDA in Vegas and keep in mind that was dragging Rio and Cromwell and Planet Hollywood were closed for the whole quarter. Planet Hollywood and Rio have opened since Bally's was also closed for part of the quarter. So we are carrying operating losses relative to those assets to get to that $60 million number. Our occupancy for the quarter in Las Vegas was just under 60% just a few basis points under 60%. We're running in the mid 50s on week days now and weekends we're well into the mid to high 90s. So we've been heartened by our performance, clearly that's a key piece of evidence on the strength of the Caesars Rewards program having to pour Caesars who we inherited on the yield management side is a wizard with this stuff and has done a tremendous job for us in Vegas and we've moved him throughout the company in this area. So we're excited with what Pavan and his group will bring to the table for us.

As I said the merger closed on July 20. So obviously that was during the quarter. Also we announced an acquisition -- cash offer to acquire William Hill during the quarter for 272 pence per share, that shareholder vote will take place on November 19 as is the case -- as needs to be the case under UK takeover code, we cash confirmed the entire amount for that transaction, including an equity offering, that was just shy of $2 billion on October 1 of this year. We entered -- we expanded our relationship with ESPN in the quarter, on the sports betting side, which we think is an exciting piece per customer acquisition for us. We've got a co-exclusive link out across all ESPN channels with DraftKings and we're excited with what that will bring to the table.

We were also active on the asset sale front, we closed the sale or we announced the sale, I'm sorry of Tropicana Evansville for $480 million to Twin River and GLPI just about a week ago. You should expect to see more news in Indiana, prior to the end of the year from us. And I would say, a couple of things that I stress as takeaways and questions that I get on the operating side of the business, if you annualize the costs that are out of the business this quarter, excluding gaming taxes which obviously reduce as gaming revenue goes down. Our run rate cost reduction is about $2 billion from pre-COVID levels. There's obviously a lot of talk about what will come back, what won't come back. A lot of those costs are never coming back. As I've said, over the last several quarters none of that has changed. As I've said, I think we're going to get to 35% to 40% EBITDA margins at a minimum, its enjoyable from my seat to see our peers in this space reporting the same types of cost savings opportunities that we've been talking about for many years and to see Las Vegas locals margins in excess of 40% for the quarter and a couple of our peers, that's a roadmap to what's coming.

You think about what revenue is missing from our business? It's the highest flow through revenue in the business, it's hotel room rates and occupancy in Las Vegas. And what I told you two quarters ago, prior to the reopening is that you were going to be surprised with what regionals could do on the margin side and we had another quarter where if you look at our peer regionals without destination properties, EBITDA was up substantially as we will get into that.

What I tell you today is when we get into a post-COVID world, the pent-up demand you're going to see for gaming in general and Las Vegas in particular is going to be beyond your wildest dreams. You're -- and the flow-through that you're going to see in the sector is unlike anything that's happened historically in this space. And so I can't tell you when is that going to happen, I can't -- I wish I could answer when the public health situation will change, but as we look at the pieces of our database that are missing or lagging, they are the most profitable pieces of our database, its the 55 and over cohort that's not coming. These are people that are not going anywhere, and are not spending, and are going to come out of this with significant pent-up demand and spending power and it's going to be extremely powerful what you'll see, I think across the entertainment space, but particularly in casinos in particularly in Las Vegas.

The other question I get all the time is about sports and online and I'd tell you our New Jersey Casino business continues to ramp up even after physical properties reopened, we're now on a run rate for $150 million of annual revenue out of the iGaming business in New Jersey at margins in the mid 30s. So we're extremely excited about that business. We think controlling our destiny in this space, positions us to be a long-term winner, that the ability to rap our iGaming in our iCasino into a single wallet attached to your Caesars Reward database with the ability to earn and use points in any way that you'd like online or offline.

Our customers truly get an immersive experience in this company, and you see it with what we're doing in Vegas, we think that's going to translate into the online business and I don't really have a roadmap to what the ultimate size of this business will be, but I do know that if you're betting against the American people's propensity to gamble or you are betting against the lower four states to attract tax revenue when their budgets are in the place that they are today, that's been a losing bet since the dawn of civilization. So I feel real good about where we are, where we're headed.

And I'll turn it over to Anthony.

Anthony Carano -- President and Chief Operating Officer

Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. I'd like to take a few minutes to provide you with some operational highlights for our portfolio during the third quarter. Before I begin, I want to express my sincere gratitude to all of our team members for their hard work and dedication during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our operations performed extremely well during these trying times, due to the outstanding service that our guests receive on a daily basis from all of our great team members. Our success this quarter is a clear reflection of the commitment our team members who continue to work hard each day to provide a safe, healthy and exciting environment for our guests and their fellow team members.

Now turning to operations. We now have 55 of our 56 properties reopened. As we mentioned in our press release, our regional properties are performing strongly. Within our regional segment and excluding destination markets like Atlantic City, Reno, New Orleans and Tahoe, our regional properties generated a revenue decline of 11% and EBITDA growth of 10%, leading to over 700 basis points of margin expansion. 10 properties had margin growth of over 1,000 basis points. In total and including the destination markets in our regional portfolio, regional EBITDA for the third quarter was $447 million.

Now turning to Las Vegas in our regional destination markets. Starting with Las Vegas, we now have every property open except the Rio. We generated $60 million of adjusted EBITDA in Las Vegas in the quarter with operating performance improving each month throughout the quarter, leading to a strong month of September. We continue to see strong occupancy trends on the weekends in excess of 90% with mid-week occupancies still running in the 50% to 60% range. We were encouraged with when Governor Sisolak lifted the meeting caps from 50 to 250 people, which has allowed us to host some small group meetings in Q4. Excluding the closed properties during the quarter, property level EBITDA was approximately $100 million.

Our destination markets in the regional portfolio displayed sequential improvement in operating performance throughout the quarter, leading to September, showing the displayed sequential improvement in operating performance throughout the quarter, leading to September showing material improvement in the rate of EBITDA decline versus July and August. These regional destination properties with large hotel room portfolios are slowly recovering as operations return to normal and customers are returning to the office. Overall, our immediate actions to reduce operating expenses and to reopen properties contributed to a leaner cost structure that we believe will contribute to sustainable EBITDA margin expansion. We are encouraged by the performance of the regional markets and the sequential rate of change in property performance within our destination markets during the quarter.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bret for some additional insights on the third quarter and details on our balance sheet and capital structure. Bret?

Bret Yunker -- Chief Financial Officer

Great, thanks Anthony. As everyone on the call is aware we had quite an active third quarter even by our own standards. We closed on the Caesars merger on July 20 and subsequently announced the proposed transaction to acquire William Hill PLC on September 30. As we mentioned in the press release, our quarter ending balance sheet was impacted by the cash required to be placed in the escrow for William Hill in connection with the Rule 2.7 announcement.

On October 1, we completed a public equity offering of 35.6 million shares generating net proceeds of $1.95 billion. Additionally, in early October, we entered into a GBP1.5 billion interim facilities agreement with two large international banks. Execution of this committed debt financing allowed us to release $2 billion of cash that have been escrowed on September 30, allowing us to fully repay a $900 million draw on our parent revolver and return excess cash liquidity to our balance sheet. As of today, both of our revolvers are undrawn and our unrestricted cash position is over $2 billion. Based on current operating trends, we expect to end the year with a similar level of cash on hand and zero revolver balances.

As I mentioned on our second quarter call, our approach to maintenance and growth capital investment will be focused and disciplined. Over the next 12 months we expect to spend approximately $300 million to $350 million on capex, excluding any Atlantic City specific capex that's already been escrowed.

With that I will turn it back to Tom.

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Bret. Let me give you -- before we go to questions, let me add a few comments on cadence of the business. Since the quarter sequentially, it continues to get stronger. October was better than September, September was better than August. If you think about what that looks like in Las Vegas, I'm going to give you some numbers that I'm not -- we're not in the habit of giving you, but given the cloudiness of business as you look at the COVID world, I think it's useful.

If you look at EBITDAR by month for us in Las Vegas, July was $10 million positive and these are aggregate numbers, so include the losses from properties that were shut down. So a $10 million in July, $16 million in August, $34 million in September and October should push $50 million. We've got preliminary numbers, we've not closed the month yet. So Vegas continues to get better for us. We are not going to be talking about shutting properties mid week, obviously we're talking about opening additional properties. We opened Cromwell last week. I'd expect to see Rio open before the end of the year.

On the Group side. The second half of '21 and beyond, have record business on our books. Q2 to Q4 '21 are well ahead of our 2019 pace and bookings were strong in the third quarter basically, at normal level of bookings. If you look at the Caesars Forum Convention Center which was opened for about a day and a half before everything shutdown from COVID, Caesars Forum has a 172 events, 1.6 million room nights contracted worth over $600 million in rooms and banquet revenue and 78% of that business is new to Las Vegas. And when I tell you is none of that matters if the public health situation does not improve, but we are heartened by Governor Sisolak's recent movement toward socially distance meeting business and his statement that he is looking to go to 50% capacity by the beginning of 2021. That should help us save some first half 2021 business, but first quarter you should expect we will look very much like the last three quarters -- the second quarter, third quarter of '20 and this quarter as well.

And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel.

Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel -- Analyst

Hey, good afternoon guys. So, Tom, I want to start in Vegas, and if you look at this point, you said your occupancies are running above 90% on the weekends, mid 50s weekdays. Is there anyway to kind of think about that we can kind of traffic, how much of that business in terms of the mid 90s is kind of a cash business versus whether that's a comp business or reward redemption?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

So you should presume that if you look at our historical mix, Steve, that the convention business has been replaced by Casino Block business and that the other segments remained relatively constant as you look back.

Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel -- Analyst

Okay, got you. And then the comments you made about demand is going to be, I think you said beyond either my wildest dreams or your wildest dreams, was that mostly related to Vegas, was that kind of across the entire US?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

It's across the entire US. When I tell you that our 55 and over Group is significantly lagging the rest of the business that's throughout the country. And those are the people that tend to skew to older population that are not leaving their houses right now. My mother is one of those. And when you get a vaccine and you have freedom of movement and feel better in terms of the likelihood of contracting COVID, I think that the pent-up demand for Vegas and for entertainment generally is well beyond what anyone is thinking today.

Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel -- Analyst

And have you seen any change in that 55 and over kind of crowd recently?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

It's everything is kind of grinding a little bit better every month, month-over-months. But it's baby steps.

Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel -- Analyst

Okay. And the last question, so with William Hill, and I don't -- I'm not sure how much you can say given the pending, the deal hasn't closed yet, but let's say that deal does go through and you talked about that single app. Do you have any idea yet in terms of when that single app would be deployed?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

I am extremely limited in what I can speak to on William Hill outside of the corner -- four corners of the document. You can presume that we were already working in that direction, in the former iteration and we would continue to work in that direction, post closing.

Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel -- Analyst

Okay, great. Thanks, Tom.

Operator

Your next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.

Thomas Allen -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Hey, how are you? So, it's now been about 3.5 months since you bought Caesars. Can you talk a little bit about additional synergy opportunities you've found that you've kind of been under the hood for a bit longer? Thanks.

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

I mean, so the whole synergy discussion as we've talked about was turned on its head by COVID. It's really a question of what comes back rather than what do you subtract, but Caesars ran differently than Eldorado, just from a basic day-to-day operation standpoint. We run our properties off of daily P&Ls across every property that we own. Caesars measurement of EBITDA was far less frequent than that. And there wasn't a lot -- the operators, didn't really have the tools to compare themselves across properties within the system.

So when we were Eldorado as a private company and we were in two markets, we could look at those two markets and say what are we doing well in one versus the other when you've got 55 that ability becomes much, much stronger, that's a benefit of scale, and Caesars was not taking advantage of that in our estimation. And you can imagine that we are -- it took us the better part of two months to get to a daily P&L and we're still working through the kinks in the Caesars system, but we just went through our first round of quarterly reviews and its eye opening for the operators to see when I'm looking at each line item, each department and versus others in my market or other similar properties, things that I was unaware that I was inefficient in become obvious and that sort of basic blocking and tackling is what we're working through now and that's why I tell you, I have an extreme level of confidence in hitting our margin targets here.

Thomas Allen -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

That's helpful, thanks. And then just on the sports I mean iGaming. Any updated thoughts around branding?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

You should expect that we will use the Caesars brand for Caesars operated, owned and operated properties. And for third-party properties, you should expect that the William Hill brand will live on in the US.

Thomas Allen -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Helpful. Thank you.

Operator

Your next question comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research.

Jared Shojaian -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Hi, good afternoon everyone and thanks for taking my question. Tom, you talked about October Vegas pushing $50 million in EBITDAR. I know there is weird seasonality with Vegas right now in the fourth quarter without the Group business and the convention business. Can you just help us think about November and December? Obviously, I know it's dependent on a lot like New Year's Eve and other holidays, but how should we think about those two months? Are you assuming that sequential step up, you've been seeing pretty consistently can continue or is there some other factors to consider there?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Jared you know you're hitting a normal soft period in Vegas that November and then pre-December, pre-Christmas December, but what we're seeing is the reduction in volumes is not nearly what it's been historically at least in our business. So we feel good about posting a strong fourth quarter number in Las Vegas.

Jared Shojaian -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Okay, thank you. And then, I'll try to tackle this question a little differently, but if I think back to your most recent synergy target that $800 million cost savings, $100 million of revenue synergies. Should we assume the entire $800 million of opportunity is already in that $2 billion number of costs that have been taken out. So really it's entirely just a matter of getting the revenue back? Or are there still some additional cost you think you could take out and then presumably the $100 million of revenue synergies is still outstanding? Is it fair to say you really haven't got any of that yet?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes, on the revenue synergies, yes, absolutely. On the cost side, the one piece that came through COVID relatively unscathed on the Caesars side was corporate. You can see in our numbers that we cut about $200 million from -- on an annualized basis from corporate and that's what we expected to do and you can see that that's complete. You should presume the rest of the cost savings are included in those numbers. But if you think about, we had an $800 million target between costs and revenue, $100 was revenue, so $700 million of costs, they did about $11 billion -- the combined companies about $11 billion of revenue and let's call it, a 28% margin for 2019. So if we were to get to our 35% left side of the range that I've been talking about, that's almost $800 million of just cost savings. And obviously, if we get to 40%, there is more than that.

Jared Shojaian -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Okay, great. Maybe just to quickly follow-up on that, I think you're divesting a lot more properties than you had initially expected when you announced the deal. Is that positive, negative or neutral to the margin?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

It depends on the properties. I would say, of the properties that we've sold and that we're anticipating selling all of those would be removing them from the equation would be accretive to that overall margin target.

Jared Shojaian -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Okay, great. Thank you very much for the time.

Operator

Your next question comes from John DeCree with Union Gaming.

John DeCree -- Union Gaming -- Analyst

Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Tom, Bret, I wanted to ask you guys a little bit about deleveraging from here and the capital that you've raised this quarter earmarked for William Hill, you've talked in the past about at some point selling a strip asset just to help delever more quickly. But based on what you see now, and the amount of costs that have come out of the business in your kind of outlook for margin, how do you approach deleveraging from here? Is it going to be through EBITDA growth, I mean you have some asset sales that you just talked about, that will help, but just curious to get your thoughts on the cadence over the next 12 or 18 months, ways that you're working on leverage?

Bret Yunker -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes, it's really going to be a combination of all of the above. Again, we're hopeful that we're nearing an inflection point here where we start generating strong free cash flow post this health crisis. So that's obviously number one. Alongside that we've been announcing asset sales and we expect to continue announcing them going forward. So that'll be part of the package and Las Vegas, we want to get past the health crisis and then think about monetizing an asset here. So all three of those alongside the denominator growing sequentially is going to help us deleverage over the next 12 to 24 months.

John DeCree -- Union Gaming -- Analyst

Thanks, Bret. And Tom on the sports and iCasino strategy, assuming the transaction with William Hill proceeds and you look at your portfolio of brands and assets. Do you see any need or opportunity to add additional services or brands or partners for that portfolio? You've got a big one with ESPN. Are there -- is there still more to do as you continue to build that business?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

This is all about building market share profitably and making your customers as sticky as possible. And so we think we have the building blocks to do that with what will have post the William Hill transaction, but we'll always be looking to improve upon that. And I found it interesting to see non-gaming entities look into this space. Just the IAC moving into MGM, obviously what ESPN did with us and DraftKings, obviously there are a lot of companies out there who are looking for share of wallet and screen-time on your phone. So wouldn't surprise me if you see more of that as we move into the future. And if there were a partnership or a transaction that would improve our position, and we could execute it in a manner that was -- that created additional value for our stakeholders, we would certainly take a serious look.

John DeCree -- Union Gaming -- Analyst

Very good. Thanks for the questions, guys.

Operator

Your next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie.

Chad Beynon -- Macquarie -- Analyst

Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question guys. Wanted to drill into the regional gaming EBITDA $444 million or I guess maybe more importantly the 33% margin. You noted that it was hamstrung by some of these regional I guess destination properties and in Lake Charles being closed. I was wondering if you're willing to, I guess, to help us think about what the drag was or if these properties had been punching at the same level as the other assets what the result would have been? Any more color just on kind of the impact there and how to think about that going forward? Thanks.

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

So you've got New Jersey, Reno and New Orleans that are your biggest drags, obviously Lake Charles this quarter given the storm, but in the -- in terms of materiality the three are Atlantic City, Reno, New Orleans. Atlantic City opened very beginning of the quarter. You had no alcohol service, you had no foodservice and significant limitations on capacity that lasted for the significant period of time during your peak season in Atlantic City. So Atlantic City comps obviously look poor. In Reno, we had the Silver Legacy Tower opened, we had a fair amount of Eldorado rooms open. We did not have the Circuit Circa -- Circuit Circus 1,600 rooms opened at all. Again, in the seasonal peak for the market and then New Orleans, New Orleans is a significant national database receiver of business. People not traveling, New Orleans as a market is their restrictions are stricter than the state itself. You have legislative mandated labor count in New Orleans and you have a tax system where we paid a fixed rate in the quarter versus the variable rate that we typically pay. So those three properties are significant drags.

As we move into fourth quarter and you get into the shoulder season, Reno and Atlantic City look a lot better, because you're doing pretty well on a comp basis mid week in those markets when properties work for this time last year and the weekend drop off is not nearly what it was in the summer. New Orleans still has all of the same issues that it had in the third quarter.

Chad Beynon -- Macquarie -- Analyst

Great. Thanks, Tom. Really helpful. And then Bret, just on the cash flow side, could you just remind us in terms of what the annual or quarterly cash interest and cash rent will be a little bit of noise in the reporting here. But that would be helpful?

Bret Yunker -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes, putting GAAP aside on a pure cash basis we're roughly $2 billion all-in of annual master lease, rent payments and interest expense. So you can just divide that by four for the quarters.

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

About $1.2 billion of rent and $800 million of interest.

Chad Beynon -- Macquarie -- Analyst

Great, thank you guys.

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks.

Your next question comes from Dan Politzer with JP Morgan.

Dan Politzer -- JP Morgan -- Analyst

Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping that you could give maybe an update on your iGaming rollout. And when we could expect to see your launch in Pennsylvania more formally at least? And maybe if there is any plans for Michigan. And if you have a market access agreement there?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes, on Michigan, an intention to rollout there. Pennsylvania I don't know...

Anthony Carano -- President and Chief Operating Officer

We are live in Pennsylvania, Dan, right now. We're rolling out more product and more games as every day and week passes. So, we're expecting to see incremental opportunities in 2021 as these new products are rolled out. So we would be optimistic in Pennsylvania in 2021. Also in the State of New Jersey, we're going to be launching live dealer on the Caesars side for iGaming. So that's an exciting opportunity as well.

Dan Politzer -- JP Morgan -- Analyst

Got it, thanks. And then, in Virginia, there was recently passed legislation that legalized gaming in Danville, where you talked about building a Casino. Can you maybe talk to us about a little bit about the project, potential cost and return to competitor environment there and how you're thinking about this at a high level?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes, so the project that was approved, we'd expect 20% returns on roughly a $400 million investment. Keep in mind, as you look at that project that's in the radius of the Cherokee property that we operate in North Carolina. And the tribe has the opportunity in the option to opt into up to 80% of the equity of the Danville property, and that became available to them upon the passage of the vote on Tuesday. So it's too early to say where that will eventually head.

Dan Politzer -- JP Morgan -- Analyst

Got it. Thanks so much guys. Appreciate it.

Operator

Your next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies.

David Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Hi. Afternoon. And thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the WMH acquisition and essentially, why now, and the degree to which you get close on it, what kind of tech investment and/or marketing spend you envision might be required to be a leader with it or could be successful with it?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So we -- as we looked at the opportunity in this space, as I've said, I think this is the most significant growth opportunity in the casino space since riverboats were legalized in the 90s. We were looking at the partnership that we brought in from the Eldorado side where if you recall, we entered that partnership knowing that Eldorado's brand was unlikely to play on a national basis. We wanted to form a partnership with a respected sports betting operator that had a national strategy where we could participate in the upside. We subsequently bought Caesars, who obviously has a very different brand situation than Eldorado, and it became clear that we have a brand that can resonate on a national level. We've got a database that can feed into that business and we have been talking about how should we proceed with the partnership. If you recall the partnership included sports betting and not -- include sports betting and not Internet casino. If you're going to get to a single wallet solution, you need both. So it really wasn't ideal for either partner in the current landscape. So as we looked at potential solutions, it became clear to us that the best answer for us was to control our own destiny here. And so we started discussions about a purchase and ended up where you saw us end up.

On the marketing question, yes, the combined company here -- the combined pro forma entity iGaming and sports does about $100 million -- will do about $100 million in EBITDA, positive EBITDA not the $200 million, $300 million of negative EBITDA that you are accustomed to in this space, it will do $100 million of positive EBITDA, that includes all of the marketing that we're doing now. So if you see us ramp-up marketing, it's from an EBITDA positive position. In terms of the tax spend, William Hill has been spending a significant amount of capital, developing its Liberty platform that rolled out in New Jersey to strong reviews. They are in the process of continuing to roll that out throughout the US. You're never going to stop spending on tech, but I don't see a significant material tax spend that's -- you should be plugging into your model, that's going to be a giant sort of cash. You should be thinking $10 million, $20 million a year neighborhood.

David Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Okay. And I recall, I hope I have your terminology correct. But the notion that iGaming and Sports Betting may warrant its own brain at some point. How have you thought about making sure that that business can grow and achieve what it needs to achieve under your roof versus its own roof?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

So it will it will be an unrestricted sub of Caesars Entertainment upon closing, post to the Caesars acquisition, Eric Hession and Chris Holdren out of the Caesars side, agreed to stay on as co-President's of that business for us. Christine Stuart on the operation side has been invaluable in this process for us, will remain involved. So you will see it as it will operate as a subsidiary of its own. You will be able to see the numbers of it on its own. Then the question becomes, what's the best structure from a capital markets perspective? And we have time to make those decisions. The expectation at the outset is it will be a wholly owned unrestricted sub of Caesars Entertainment will not have its own currency, but as you know, we are 100% focused on driving value to our shareholders and if the right answer is, it becomes a separate entity with its own currency, you might see us head in that direction in the future.

David Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Great, thank you so much.

Your next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist Securities.

Barry Jonas -- Truist Securities -- Analyst

Hey, guys. I wanted to start with Vegas. Can you maybe just talk about the reintroduction of entertainment. How profitable do you think that can be either directly or indirectly. And then also what's been the response so far to the return of paid parking? Thanks.

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes, so on the question of entertainment, we're absolutely thrilled that we've seen movement in that area and the ability to operate what are some fairly small venue entertainment across the city, what you're seeing coming back, you're not seeing headlined Entertainment come back, you are not seeing big production shows come back, what you're seeing are the 500 to 600 seats that are now offering 100 to 200 seats. It's not a hugely profitable business on its own. But it creates additional reason to visit the market and that's important to us. Every piece that we get that becomes another reason for someone to make the move to either drive here or fly here and stay in the market is good for the whole market. So we're extremely pleased that we're able to offer Entertainment today. The initial response has been extremely strong and we're happy to have it back.

On the issue of parking, you've got a heavy drive-in business now, as I said we're mid to high 90s occupancy on the weekends as you -- and you know that we have kind of 50-yard line real estate on the strip. So we were finding was our best customers were having difficulty finding parking in our garages even if they had a lodging reservation. And so what we wanted to do was to bring back parking for -- to bring back parking fees as kind of hurdle so that our best customers can get to the property. If you are significant to Caesars or a customer you are a larger of you're a local, you're not paying for parking and to drive home the point that this was for those purposes, and because of the situation that we've seen in the radar, we -- as we implemented, we said we are going to donate all of our profits from parking for this quarter and next to the local charities that support the community and those that have been displaced by COVID. So the response has been overwhelmingly positive from the city and from our customers.

Barry Jonas -- Truist Securities -- Analyst

That's great. And then just a follow-up. How are you thinking about I guess PropCo mix to the business. Now, Tom in the past you've talked about sort of like a 50-50 mix. Is that still the goal once the dust settles?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes, you should see us doing a sale-leaseback transactions of or sales of real estate that will skew that as you've seen us in the past we've utilized the PropCo market for financing typically for transactions. So were there something to come up that made sense. It could be a tool that used, but I don't expect us to be particularly acquisitive from here. So you shouldn't see much movement on the real estate side.

Barry Jonas -- Truist Securities -- Analyst

Great. Thank you so much.

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks Barry.

Your next question comes from Shaun Kelly with Bank of America.

Shaun Kelly -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Hi. Good afternoon everyone. Two questions. Just wanted to go back to the sort of regional margin performance. If we look at the kind of the numbers on a quarter basis, talking about the 700 basis points, is it fair just as we think about recognition of some of that synergy is going to be your initiative, that's got 700 basis points could actually improve or accelerate from here? Or do you think this is a good reflection of what the ability of the business can be when everything else is -- everything else starts to settle in?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

You should expect that there is -- that it can continue to grow, because as I talked about earlier, what's missing from the business is some of your highest flow through revenue. So as that starts to come back into these markets that I'm thinking particularly of Atlantic City, Reno and New Orleans, flow through is quite high and their contribution to the total regional pie in a post-COVID world should drive the entire regional sector margin higher.

Shaun Kelly -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

That's really helpful, Tom. And then sort of a separate the big picture strategic question. So there's been some discussion as it relates to William Hill. And I guess the bigger kind of picture strategy here as it relates to this kind of single wallet or access to the customer probably be via an app. And I'm just kind of curiously Caesars always took a pretty centralized or increasingly move to a centralized marketing approach. Tom at Eldorado I think without mischaracterizing you guys always pretty focused on a decentralized approach truly accessing the customers empowering some of the local property managers. How do you think about that in the digital realm. So just sort of how do you kind of like connect all this together as it relates to software and one vision of the customer. Does it sort of need to be centralized or can you balance those two approaches and how would you sort of go about doing it or is there anything need to change?

Tom Reeg -- Chief Executive Officer

I mean I think as you think about it as to how we operate the entire business, what will differentiate us in this space is the stickiness of our customers, the immersion in our network. If you think about I know you're in the free-COVID world you would -- you would be a frequent traveler like I was think of the gymnastics, you would go through to make sure that you are flying on your favorite airline or you're staying in your hotel where you've got the most points, that's what we've got in the Caesars Reward system and it's a much broader relationship then just how much money did I give you to place your sports bet on my app, it's a much stickier customers. So you shouldn't think of the sports betting marketing is going to be materially different than the way that we built the business on the bricks and mortar side. I understand there's this race for market share and handle and all the numbers that come out monthly right now. This is a long game.

I go back to my riverboats example. I remember calling on names like Casino Magic and Casino America and players international are Argosy Gaming. All of those ultimately went away and got consolidated into the leaders in the business that's where we're going to end up. You are in inning one of you know if you're thinking in baseball terms what ultimately will be an extra-inning game and we're assembling the building blocks to be a winner here long-term to attract as much share market share as we can over time profitably, but make sure that it's sticky. I can make my market share in any individual market, look the way that I'd want it to look to report to you at the end of the month if I throw enough money at it. That's not how we do business. That's not how you should expect us to tackle this area.

Shaun Kelly -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Thank you very much.

Companies that offer online sports gambling rallied Wednesday morning after a trio of states voted in favor of ballot measures aimed at legalizing sports betting and other gaming expansion.

DraftKings Inc. rallied as much as 6.2%, the most in three weeks. The gains were spread across the industry, with Penn National Gaming Inc. rising 6.1%. Flutter Entertainment Plc the owner of FanDuel, is on track for a record close in London after rising as much as 2.5%. The Roundhill Sports Betting & iGaming ETF, commonly-known by its ticker BETZ, rose 1.8% after posting its best day in more than a month on Tuesday.

Maryland voted to legalize sports and event betting at certain facilities, while South Dakota backed a proposition that would allow legal sportsbooks in the region that’s home to its casinos as early as next year. Louisiana approved a proposition that cleared a hurdle to allow sports betting. The trifecta of wins added to investor optimism in the growing industry’s potential to rake in billions more in revenue.

Regulations will still need to be finalized, but the developments across the three states will open up a roughly $537 million market, according to Morgan Stanley. “While the referenda outcomes were expected, they support the argument that there is positive legislative momentum, which should be enhanced in early 2021 when most legislatures go back into session,” analyst Thomas Allen wrote.
