Apple's New M1 Chip Could Boost Mac Margins,Motley Fool,6 days ago,"Apple's silicon delivers improved performance while significantly enhancing power efficiency, leading to massive gains in battery life. Developing the M1 cost ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/12/apples-new-m1-chip-could-boost-mac-margins/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","After nearly a decade of speculation, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at long last unveiled its first ARM-based Macs -- MacBook Air, MacBook, and Mac Mini -- powered by its new M1 chip, displacing Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) processors after 15 years. Apple's silicon delivers improved performance while significantly enhancing power efficiency, leading to massive gains in battery life.

Developing the M1 cost billions, but the new chip could still bode well for Apple's Mac margins in the long run.

Ditching Intel

For starters, Intel chips cost hundreds of dollars each. Apple has undoubtedly secured volume discounts, but how much it pays the chip giant has never been clear. Analysts estimate that Intel sells about $3.4 billion in chips to Apple annually, but lacking unit sales data, it's difficult to estimate how much Apple pays for each processor.

By switching to its own processors, Apple will pay far less -- just the manufacturing costs that it pays to foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM).

Investors have long anticipated these cost savings, but they didn't know what Apple would do with them. Would Apple pass along those savings to consumers in the form of lower prices, or pocket them to expand margins?

A little bit of both

Ahead of the event, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee estimated that the shift would result in $75 per unit in cost savings. The analyst expected Apple to offer a new laptop priced in between the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which could boost demand and sell more units.

It turns out that the answer is a mix of both strategies. The M1-powered MacBook Air and MacBook Pro have the same respective starting prices, but the M1-powered Mac Mini is getting a $100 price cut. The MacBook Air is the Cupertino tech giant's most popular model, so most of those cost savings will translate into higher margins.

However, it could take some time for those higher margins to materialize. Generally speaking, processors built on the newest manufacturing technologies -- in this case, TMSC's 5-nanometer process -- often run into low yields as the foundry works out early kinks. Low yields lead to higher unit costs, as some of the silicon wafer ends up wasted. As the manufacturing process matures, yields improve, and costs come down.

Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong believes this may be why Apple kept the M1-powered MacBooks at the same price points. But over time, the costs per unit should decline and result in greater profitability. Once the rest of the Mac lineup is transitioned to Apple processors, earnings per share could increase by an estimated $0.13, or about 3%, according to Cowen analyst Krish Sankar.

""The new M1 chip is a positive step in leveraging existing R&D investments in silicon design ... [giving] better control over its technology road map while also allowing the company to optimize the cost structure of Mac systems going forward,"" Sankar wrote in a research note to investors this week.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.722, 'pos': 0.278, 'compound': 0.4019}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.636, 'pos': 0.364, 'compound': 0.7906}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.636, 'pos': 0.364, 'compound': 0.7906}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.3953,0.4019,0.3953,0.39749999999999996,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive
Why You Should Be Buying This Tech Stock in November,Motley Fool,6 days ago,"The chipmaker reportedly gets a substantial chunk of its revenue from Apple, and its largest customer supplied 21% of the total revenue last quarter. Synaptics' ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/12/why-you-should-be-buying-this-tech-stock-november/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Synaptics (NASDAQ:SYNA) has beaten the broader stock market handsomely over the past year thanks to its shift to a higher-margin business model, and it looks like the shares have more upside to offer given the company's latest quarterly results.

The chipmaker's fiscal 2021 first-quarter earnings jumped significantly over the prior-year period on the back of strong momentum across the PC, mobile, and the Internet of Things (IoT) businesses. Synaptics exceeded its own expectations last quarter, and claims to have a nice pipeline of design wins and new product ramps that could help it move into a higher gear in this new fiscal year.

Let's see why Synaptics could remain a top tech stock and sustain its impressive rally.

Synaptics is making the right moves

Synaptics' fiscal first-quarter revenue came in at $328.4 million, down 3% over the prior-year period but higher than the midpoint of the company's guidance range of $315 million to $335 million. The lower revenue was because Synaptics' now-divested TDDI (touch and display driver integration) business was a part of the mobile segment in the year-ago quarter.

The liquid-crystal display (LCD) TDDI business generated $131 million in revenue in the first half of fiscal 2020 (about $65 million per quarter). So investors shouldn't be worried about the company's revenue decline, as it managed to substantially improve its margin profile thanks to the divestment.

Synaptics reported non-GAAP gross margin of 49.7% in the previous quarter, a huge jump over the prior-year period's figure of 41.5% and the highest level it has seen in over seven years. The company also clocked its highest operating margin in over six years. The margin gains translated into a nice earnings bump, with Synaptics reporting adjusted earnings of $1.85 per share, compared to $1.22 per share in the year-ago quarter.

The company is expected to enjoy strong earnings growth through the new fiscal year thanks to the divestment of the TDDI business and its focus on the higher-margin organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display driver segment. Rosenblatt Securities estimates that the sale of the TDDI business could boost Synaptics' earnings by $0.45 to $0.55 per share in fiscal 2021.

Major catalysts ahead

Synaptics' mobile business supplied 40% of its total revenue last quarter, and it is playing a key role in driving up its margins as the smartphone market shifts from LCDs to OLEDs. The company anticipates 10 new smartphones equipped with its OLED touch controllers to hit the market in the coming months, though it may have a huge winner on its hands in the form of the new Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 12 models.

Synaptics management pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that:

We also had our major handset OEM [original equipment manufacturer] announce their new flagship phones last month powered by our OLED touch controller.

The chipmaker reportedly gets a substantial chunk of its revenue from Apple, and its largest customer supplied 21% of the total revenue last quarter. Synaptics' mobile revenue shot up 25% year over year after adjusting for the sale of the TDDI business, and it is likely to sustain its momentum given reports that Apple is preparing to increase production and ship over 200 million units next year. The new iPhones could drive a mega upgrade cycle for Apple, and Synaptics could ride on the smartphone giant's coattails.

Looking beyond mobile, Synaptics is turning up the heat in the IoT business. The segment accounted for 35% of Synaptics' revenue last quarter, and it is expected to exceed the mobile business in size in the fiscal second quarter. The IoT business is benefiting from a broad range of growth trends in video interface solutions, audio chips, and smart homes.

With the IoT chip market expected to clock double-digit growth rates in the coming years, according to third-party estimates, it isn't surprising to see why Synaptics sees better days ahead in this business. So, investors who have been on the sidelines so far should take a closer look at Synaptics, as it has the ingredients to keep growing at a nice clip.

Finally, Synaptics trades at an attractive valuation. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24 is way lower than the five-year average multiple of 94. Meanwhile, a forward P/E ratio of 14.6 points toward future earnings growth, which Synaptics should be able to deliver given the catalysts it is sitting on.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.927, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.2023}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.927, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.2023}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.10115,0.0,0.10115,0.06743333333333333,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Positive,Neutral,Somewhat Positive

It has been a front-runner in the technology sector ever since its early days and its products have helped propel its stock price, making it one of the largest companies in the world by market cap.

Despite its already massive size, Apple continues to report growth. Still, Apple's size is weighing down on its growth rate and if the recent growth trend continues, it's unlikely that Apple's share price performance for the next decade can match the past.

Fortunately, there are many other leading tech stocks with better prospects than Apple that investors can consider. One of them is Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY).

The rise of a major tech company

Tencent is the No. 1 player in China across multiple business segments: online games, mobile messaging, online video, online payment, and music, just to mention a few. Its flagship social media app, WeChat, has 1.2 billion monthly active users (MAUs), behind only Facebook, which has 2.7 billion MAUs.

It didn't begin as a sure-win business. It started as a one-product company focusing on QQ -- an instant messaging software -- in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The product became a hit among users, making it the de facto instant messaging software in China during the PC era. Tencent then went on to provide additional services -- online games, entertainment, news, and more -- to delight its hundreds of millions of users. Its crown jewel, WeChat, came much later, and in many ways is an evolved version of QQ tailored for the mobile era.

Why is Tencent so successful

Among all the things that have contributed to Tencent's success, two stand out: its massive user base and its diversified business model.

The former is a result of Tencent's leadership in social messaging tools, which are extremely popular among Chinese users thanks to the strong network effect -- where every additional user will make its network more valuable to all existing users.

Unlike its peers such as WhatsApp, which remains mainly a messaging app, WeChat went further by offering all kinds of other services, including e-commerce, online food ordering, payments, blogging, games, and music. These additional services not only make WeChat extremely sticky among its users, but they also became new income streams for Tencent.

The result? A diversified and profitable technology conglomerate. Between 2004, the year of its IPO, and 2019, Tencent grew revenue and net profit by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47%, and 43%, respectively. It might seem that its business model runs the risk of making it a jack-of-all-trades and a master of none, but instead of doing everything on its own, Tencent has extensive partnerships (including holding stakes) with other companies in areas including e-commerce and online food delivery. These relationships help solidify its ecosystem.

A strength you may be overlooking



Many investors don't know that Tencent is probably one of the best (if not the best) capital allocators in the world. According to South China Morning Post, Tencent had invested in about 700 companies for the decade ended in 2019, many of which have either gone public or become unicorns, private companies with a valuation of more than $1 billion.

Some of its better-known investments are Pinduoduo, Meituan, JD, Sea Ltd, EPIC games, and Didi. Tencent owns more than 10% of each of those companies. It also owns minority stakes in leading companies like Tesla, Snap, Spotify, and Uber. As of June 30, these investments had a value of about $77 billion.

These companies are leaders in their respective fields, and Tencent stands to benefit as they continue to grow. With its streams of cash coming in each year, Tencent will likely continue its investments in other companies to create value for its shareholders.

Nonetheless, there's a risk that future investments might not be as successful. Hence, investors should look out for potential misallocation of capital, especially if it ventures into industries far beyond its core competence.

Tencent as a long-term investment

Tencent is a rare combination of a great business operator and a successful capital allocator.

I think Tencent's future is equally bright, if not brighter, than its past. It has huge potential to grow its existing businesses in advertising, fintech, and healthcare, and also expand its younger, enterprise-facing businesses such as cloud computing.

At around a $745 billion market cap, Tencent is already a gigantic company. But a decade from now, it could be worth much more. It has a good chance to outperform Apple thanks to its smaller size and its proven capital allocation strategies.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.655, 'neu': 0.345, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.2263}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.805, 'pos': 0.195, 'compound': 0.4404}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.778, 'pos': 0.222, 'compound': 0.7506}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.778, 'pos': 0.222, 'compound': 0.7506}]",0.7506,0.10705,0.7506,0.5360833333333334,Positive,Very Positive,Somewhat Positive,Very Positive
2 Cheap Dividend Stocks You Can Buy Right Now,Motley Fool,6 days ago,"Broadcom also generated a fifth of its revenues from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) last year, so it should benefit from robust sales of the iPhone 12 over the next few ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/12/2-cheap-dividend-stocks-you-can-buy-right-now/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","With the Nasdaq hovering near all-time highs, many tech stocks can't be considered cheap. Most high-growth tech companies also don't pay dividends, since they usually reinvest their cash into their expanding businesses.

But for investors who favor stability and income over high-risk growth, there are still plenty of tech stocks that pay high dividends and trade at low valuations. Let's take a closer look at two companies that fit that description: Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and IBM (NYSE:IBM).

1. Broadcom

Broadcom sells a wide range of chips for the data center, networking hardware, storage, broadband, wireless, and industrial markets. It also expanded into the infrastructure software market with its acquisitions of CA Technologies in 2018 and Symantec's security business in 2019.

Broadcom's stock rallied about 20% this year as the strength of its infrastructure software unit offset the pandemic-related disruptions of its semiconductor business. Its total revenue rose 4% year over year in the first nine months of 2020, but its adjusted EPS dipped 1% -- mainly due to the costs of integrating Symantec's security business.

Broadcom's sales of networking and broadband chips also stabilized sequentially in the second and third quarters, as cloud and telecom customers upgraded their infrastructure to address the surge in online activity throughout the pandemic. Analysts currently expect Broadcom's revenue and earnings to rise 6% and 3%, respectively, for the full year.

But looking into 2021, analysts expect Broadcom's revenue and earnings to rise 9% and 16%, respectively, as the pandemic passes and the expanding 5G and cloud markets lift sales of its networking and wireless chips. Broadcom also generated a fifth of its revenues from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) last year, so it should benefit from robust sales of the iPhone 12 over the next few quarters.

Broadcom has a well-diversified business, a wide moat, and its stock trades at just 15 times forward earnings. It currently pays a forward dividend yield of 3.4%, and it plans to spend about half of its free cash flow (FCF) on dividends every year. It spent 48% of its FCF on its dividend over the past 12 months -- which indicates its dividend remains rock-solid even as other companies cut or suspend their payouts.

2. IBM

IBM became a Dividend Aristocrat of the S&P 500 earlier this year after raising its dividend for the 25th straight year. Unfortunately, joining that elite group didn't prevent IBM's stock from dropping 14% this year as investors lost patience with its sluggish turnaround efforts.

But three significant things recently happened at IBM. First, IBM acquired the open source software provider Red Hat in July 2019. That acquisition expanded its hybrid cloud business, which allows companies to store their data on both public cloud platforms and on-site private clouds.

Second, Arvind Krishna, IBM's cloud and cognitive solutions chief, succeeded Ginni Rometty as its new CEO in April and immediately focused on expanding its higher-growth cloud businesses.

Lastly, Krishna recently revealed IBM would spin off its slow-growth IT services segment into a new company that prioritizes the growth of its hybrid cloud and AI businesses. That spin-off won't happen until late 2021, but it indicates IBM is finally streamlining its sprawling business and focusing on growing its revenue again.

For now, IBM's growth looks anemic. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to decline 4% and 34%, respectively, this year, as the ongoing pandemic throttles the growth of most of its non-cloud businesses.

But looking ahead into 2021, analysts expect IBM's revenue and earnings to rise 1% and 38%, respectively, as the pandemic passes. After IBM spins off its IT services segment, which constantly erases the growth of its cloud-based businesses, its growth should accelerate significantly in 2022 and beyond.

IBM's stock won't blast off anytime soon, but it trades at just 10 times forward earnings and pays a meaty forward dividend yield of 5.7%. It's unclear if the ""new"" IBM will remain a Dividend Aristocrat after its upcoming split, but the company has said that both new companies will pay a combined quarterly dividend that is ""no less"" than IBM's current dividend.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.173, 'compound': 0.6872}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.173, 'compound': 0.6872}]",0.6872,0.0,0.6872,0.45813333333333334,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive

Prepared Remarks:

Operator

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the third-quarter 2020 Jamf earnings conference call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Jennifer Gaumond.

Ma'am, you may begin.

Jennifer Gaumond -- Investor Relations

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Jamf's third-quarter 2020 financial results. With me on today's call are Dean Hager, Jamf's chief executive officer; and Jill Putman, the company's chief financial officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that shortly after the market closed today, Jamf issued a press release announcing its third-quarter 2020 financial results. Additionally, we published an updated investor presentation.

You may access the press release and presentation on the Investor Relations section of jamf.com. Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements, please refer to our most recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q and our IPO prospectus dated July 21, 2020, where you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these statements. I would also like to remind you that during the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures related to Jamf's performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in our quarterly financial statements.

To ensure we can address as many analyst questions as possible during the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one initial question and one follow-up. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dean Hager. Dean?

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Jennifer, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on our third-quarter earnings call. For our call today, I will share highlights from the quarter and then provide an update about the exciting momentum in our business. I'll finish with a recap of our annual user conference before turning it over to Jill to review our third-quarter financials. While a challenging macroeconomic environment persists, the tailwinds of telehealth, distance learning, and remote work in the third quarter offset economic headwinds and drove strong Jamf sales growth and customer acquisition.

Total revenue in the third quarter grew 29% year over year to $70.4 million, driven by recurring revenue growth of 40% year over year to $65.8 million, now 93% of total revenues. Annual recurring revenue or ARR was $261.5 million growing 37% year over year. Non-GAAP operating income was $12 million in the quarter or 17% of revenue. This was a 0.5 point decrease over the third quarter of 2019.

And unlevered free cash flow totaled $28.2 million in the third quarter, representing an unlevered free cash flow margin of 40%. This compares with a margin of 33% for third-quarter 2019. Our strong third-quarter results reflect the continuing trend of IT consumerization the fuels the growth of Apple and the enterprise. This trend where employees demand to use at work, the technology they already love at home, has accelerated over the past six months.

Jamf has responded by helping thousands of organizations around the globe implement remote work solutions, as well as helping schools with distance-learning and hospitals with their telehealth solutions. Jamf's value to customers and our business results continue to strengthen as these trends further route themselves into daily life, both in the short term and far into the future. Despite the challenges of 2020, Jamf remains dedicated to our customer success, and we have continued to invest in new features and enhancements that fulfill our mission to help them succeed with Apple. As organizations work hard to provide a safe environment for their teams and customers, technology plays an important role across industries like retail, transportation, and healthcare.

Jamf continues to support this effort and gains momentum with our innovative products such as Jamf Setup and Jamf Reset that enables shared yet personalized usage of iPhones and iPads. And for workflows specifically designed for hospitals, Jamf's Healthcare Listener integrates with our hospitals' electronic medical record system and listens to the messages like a patient discharge or transfer and automatically performs the desired remote command like wiping the device or associating the device with all of the connected things in the patient's new hospital room. This workflow uses iPads to create a better and more engaging experience for the patient without requiring time or effort from the IT or hospital staff. Jamf's Virtual Visits solutions, which launched weeks after the COVID-19 outbreak allow patients to seamlessly and securely connect with doctors and their families through third-party video meeting platforms like ZOOM and Microsoft Team.

UCHealth in Colorado is just one hospital using all of these innovations. In 2018, UCHealth began using Jamf to streamline their technology management and practices by offering an iPad at each patient's bedside. They utilized Healthcare Listener, Jamf Setup, and Jamf Reset to digitally sterilize the device between each patient and easily set it up for the next patient without the need for IT assistance. As virtual care need spiked, this quarter UCHealth started using our Virtual Visits workflow and ramped up from less than 50 virtual visits a day to over 1,500.

Both Healthcare Listener and Virtual Visits have patents pending. Also during this quarter, Jamf advanced our relationship with hospitals around the world by implementing clinical communication workflows. Cincinnati Children's Hospital, the number three children's hospital in the U.S. selected Jamf for thousands of iPhones for nurses to help optimize clinical communication and patient care.

And they also used our solution to deploy iPads to patient rooms for entertainment, social connection, and access to medical information directly from their Epic electronic medical record system. Additionally, Cincinnati Children's extended their Jamf usage to Apple TVs and patient rooms. Jamf's unique healthcare capabilities across the entire Apple ecosystem of products led to these hospitals choosing Jamf over legacy MDM solutions in order to succeed with their Telehealth, clinical communication, and patient bedside initiatives. In the third quarter, Jamf also experienced strong growth in the education market, largely driven by a worldwide requirement for schools to be distance-learning ready.

These programs are aided through government funding like the CARES Act in the U.S., the GIGA project in Japan, and DiGA pack in Germany. In Japan, Jamf on-boarded 56 school districts, which include over 1,000 schools in Q3 alone. In the US, Jamf is the clear leader for Apple Enterprise Management in education. We serve 12 of the 15 largest school districts in the United States.

Eight of these schools have increased their seat count with Jamf since the COVID-19 outbreak. Jamf has been preparing schools for kids to learn from their homes for years whether they know it or not. Our Jamf Teacher app provides educators with real-time classroom remote control of each student's Apple technology from any distance, and our Jamf Parent app allows parents to do the same. Both these apps are designed to empower adults to help students avoid potential distractions and focus on their studies.

Since the pandemic began, Jamf has further advanced our solution, including new capabilities such as teachers virtually ringing the bell in order to easily starts their video class room, and allowing students to virtually raise their hand in order to gain further assistance from educators, which is valuable for students learning at home or in a classroom setting. Last month, we also launched Jamf Assessment, an app that empowers schools to issue remotely proctored exams, where it's necessary to visually supervise students like with college placement exams or another high-stake testing, something that was not previously possible on the iPad. Sewanhaka Central High School District in New York used Jamf Assessment this quarter to allow students to take the Accuplacer test, a test that assists colleges in placing students in the right courses, helping them continue to build their future, despite the uncertainty stemming from the pandemic. Additionally, Jamf is seeing strong interest for both Mac and iPad in higher education.

The Ohio State University has been providing iPads for every incoming freshman since 2018 as part of their digital flagship program. In the third quarter of 2020, Ohio State conducted a survey that own well over 90% of their students agreed that iPads are useful for academic purposes and a valuable tool for their education. Similarly, the University of Kentucky is in the second year of issuing iPad technology to first-year students. More than 11,000 devices have been distributed as part of a wider smart campus strategy geared toward better leveraging technology in new and innovative ways.

In total, over 300 universities or higher education customers have expanded their use of Jamf, since the COVID-19 pandemic began. We believe the strong Apple usage in universities further confirmed Jamf's research finding that over 70% of college students would prefer to use a Mac at work if given the choice after graduation. Speaking of using Apple at work, the need to remotely and securely connect and empower employees working from their homes has continued to lead companies to choose Jamf, and grow their Apple and, specifically Mac usage. This trend, which was gaining popularity before the pandemic, has been accelerated this year and we believe will continue into the future.

In the third quarter, Jamf advanced workflows that improve the employee experience, security, and IT efficiency through Jamf Connect and Jamf Protect. Jamf released new capabilities in Jamf Protect and announced a new version of Jamf Connect that makes it easier to deploy and further streamline employee on boarding and authentication using single sign-on and biometrics with password-must access to the Mac using Face ID from an iPhone. These advancements led to approximately 700 customers choosing Jamf Connect, and approximately 200 customers choosing Jamf Protect, which was launched exactly one year ago today since the COVID-19 outbreak began. In the third quarter, Upwork, Everlane, and HSBC are all examples of new Jamf Connect wins.

And examples of Jamf Protect wins include Gilead Sciences, Data health and SAP, but SAP having already deployed Jamf Protect to over 28,000 MacBooks. These customers are part of a fast-growing trend, where organizations leverage Jamf's entire Apple Enterprise Management platform. As part of our expansion initiatives, Jamf is now offering a new user base pricing bundle called Jamf Business Plan, which includes Jamf Pro, Jamf Protect, and Jamf Connect across all Apple devices used by employees. Jamf Business Plan provides organizations with a complete solution that delivers a strong return on investment and lower support costs.

All of these new capabilities were showcased as we closed Q3 when we hosted approximately 20,000 attendees at our virtual Jamf Nation User Conference, also known as JNUC, which is 10 times our normal in-person conference attendance. JNUC is annually the largest gathering of Apple IT admins globally and we believe this year's JNUC was the largest gathering of Apple IT admins anywhere ever. This year we welcomed many first timers, who have not participated in previous conferences, plus an amazing 28% of attendees this year were Jamf prospects, not customers, which supports the strong and growing demand we have seen for Apple Enterprise Management. JNUC provides a forum for collaboration in this year was no different, based on the communication threads during the event and Chatter that we experienced post-event.

On average virtual JNUC attendees spent more than 30 hours in the platform, engaging and participating in Jamf content, and nine and 10 agreed that JNUC 2020 met their expectations and plan to attend again a virtual next year. The theme of the conference was a year like no other, and we showcased many of the platform enhancements, I mentioned earlier, that are powering the learn, care and work anywhere trends, along with customer and partner stories and how they were able to succeed during this time using Apple and Jamf. Apple and Microsoft representatives also joined us on stage, again this year, to talk about our important partnerships and what they bring to the Apple IT and security communities. We announced we are expanding our collaboration with Microsoft Enterprise Mobility and Security by launching iOS Device Compliance.

Through this offering, which adds to our already robust partnership, organizations are empowered to choose Jamf or Apple Enterprise, including device compliance and security monitoring for remote staff, and Microsoft Endpoint Manager for any other devices. As trends like employee technology choice programs and IT continue to grow organizations need management tools that can adapt and shift to a hybrid environment, while still giving the native and intended end-user experience. At JNUC, we also announced our acquisition of Mondada. Mondada's Kinobi solutions are considered the leading solution and patch management for the Apple platform.

Built exclusively around Jamf, Kinobi, and Kinobi Pro managed software compliance on macOS, a major initiative, and a pain point for today's IT teams. We believe with Jamf's resources, we can extend these capabilities and bring even greater value to organizations using the Apple ecosystem through a complete application lifecycle management solution. We closed this tuck-in acquisition on October 15. As we look into the future, we are excited about the continued transformation of the enterprise, as the consumerization of IT results in more Apple devices, empowering employees at work, educating students in school, and helping provide care for patients and hospitals and at home.

While the events of 2020 have accelerated these trends, we believe we are still in the early innings of this transformation. Going forward, Jamf commits to continue innovating at the pace of Apple, supporting new operating systems and hardware on the same day it's released, including the recently announced Mac lineup based on the Apple M1 chip, and Apple's latest operating system Big Sur, which became generally available today. We believe Mac will become increasingly the device of choice for many in the workplace, especially the newest generation of workers, and that Jamf is best positioned to help organizations easily adapt and get the most out of this new technology over time. Unlike cross-platform management and security solutions that are still struggling to fully support macOS Catalina let alone macOS Big Sur.

Jamf is solely focused on Apple and for a decade has supported an extended Apple's latest innovations from the day they are available. In closing, we are excited to be a part of this movement and to support the continued growth in the large and growing Apple Enterprise Management market. Now I would like to turn the call over to Jill to walk through our financial results and guidance. Jill?

Jill Putman -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Dean, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. I'll start by discussing our third-quarter results in detail before moving on to guidance. As Dean mentioned, we had a very strong third quarter. Total revenue for the third quarter was $70.4 million, growing 29% year over year, reflecting strong growth across all of our subscription products.

Recurring revenue totaled $65.8 million in the third quarter, an increase of 40% year over year, and accounted for 93% of our total revenue versus 86% in the third quarter last year, while non-recurring revenue was $4.6 million. Due to product mix shift, we saw a favorable impact from products that deliver in-quarter recurring revenue as the education vertical and our Jamf's Connect product outperformed our expectations. ARR, as of September 30th, was $261.5 million, an increase of 37% year over year. As a reminder, ARR represents the annualized value of all subscription, support, and maintenance contracts as of the end of the period.

ARR mitigates fluctuations due to seasonality, contract term, and the sales mix of subscription for term-based licenses versus staff. Three primary drivers underpin the growth of our ARR. First, our consistent high device expansion rates, second, our strong new logo acquisition, and third, the upselling and cross-selling of products into our installed base. We expect to continue benefiting from these trends going forward.

We believe our ability to grow the number of devices on our software platform is a key indicator of our growth and trajectory. As of the end of Q3, we had 18.6 million devices on our platform, representing strong growth in both the education and commercial verticals and across all major geographies as demand continues for organizations to remotely connect, manage, and protect their Apple devices. We have a history of attracting new customers and growing their annual spend with us over time, which drives our high-dollar-based net retention rate. We accomplished this by adding devices to our platform and expanding our customers' adoption of our add-on products.

Our dollar-based net retention rate remained strong at 117% for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2020. Before turning to expense items and profitability, I would like to highlight that I will refer to non-GAAP results for my remaining remarks. Our GAAP financial results along with reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP are found in our earnings release. Gross profit was $58.2 million, up 35% year over year, while gross margin expanded four points to 83%.

We expect our gross margin to increase over time as compared to the rates we delivered prior to the impact of COVID, as recurring revenue becomes the larger proportion of revenue and as an increase the average ARR per device. Turning to operating expenses, we remain focused on improving the leverage in our business, while balancing our investments for growth. With the strength of our operating results year to date, we've been able to increase our investment throughout the organization by turning our original 2020 hiring plan back on. As a result, to date, Jamf has on-boarded 250 new employees since the beginning of the year, which has been aided by leveraging Jamf's zero-touch technology in the midst of the pandemic.

Total operating expense for Q3 was $46.3 million, compared to $33.6 million in Q3 last year. Year-over-year growth was driven primarily by continued investments in our global go-to-market strategy as well as investments in research and development as innovation in both our existing and new products and features remains a top priority for us. In addition, beginning in the third quarter, we now have incremental expense related to being a public company. As a reminder, we delayed some planned spending in Q2 due to COVID and invested a portion of that expense savings this quarter.

The larger portion of that savings will be invested between now and the end of the year, resulting in an uptick in spending in the fourth quarter. Our operating income in the quarter was $12 million, compared to $9.6 million in Q3 last year. Operating margin was 17%, representing a half-point decrease compared to the same period last year, reflecting investments required to be a public company, partially offset by improved gross margin. Our basic average share count was 113.2 million and our diluted average share count was 116.7 million for the quarter as compared to 102.8 million and 104.6 million, respectively in the third quarter of 2019.

Unlevered free cash flow was $28.2 million in Q3 compared to $17.9 million for Q3 2019. Third-quarter unlevered free cash flow represents 40% of total revenue, up from 33% of total revenue a year ago. Our operating model of high growth and improving efficiency yield strong cash flow generation, which in the third quarter also benefited from seasonally strong billings in the education vertical, which outpaced the increase in our operating cost investments. Late in the quarter, we accelerated our hiring efforts and expect to make further investments in the fourth quarter.

Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $177.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. And, finally, we turn to guidance for the fourth quarter. Our business has seen some benefits from several trends emerging during this challenging time, including the proliferation of telehealth, remote learning, and the rise of a more permanent work-from-home movement. At the same time, there is embedded uncertainty around the IT spending environment as renewals, capital spending, and new IT projects are subject to more scrutiny across organizations everywhere.

In light of these dynamics and our strong performance in the third quarter, we are increasing our full-year 2020 revenue and non-GAAP operating income expectations. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect total revenue in the range of $70 million to $71 million, representing growth of 23% to 25% year over year and a 3.7% increase from previous implied guidance. Non-GAAP operating income in the range of $1 million to $2 million. For the full-year 2020, we expect total revenue in the range of $263 million to $264 million, representing growth of 28% to 29% year over year and a 2.9% increase from previous guidance.

Non-GAAP operating income in the range of $28.5 million to $29.5 million, reflecting the increase in operating expenses related to accelerated hiring and reinvesting our over-performance back into the business as discussed earlier. For modeling purposes, we are providing the following information. We expect an annual effective tax rate of 25%. As a reminder, we use our statutory tax rate when calculating tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments, which is not materially different from our annual effective tax.

For calculating GAAP EPS, we expect basic weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately $116 million for the fourth quarter and $109 million for the full-year 2020. In closing, we are very pleased with our performance in the third quarter and look forward to sharing our results in the quarters ahead. With that, Dan and I will take your questions. Operator?

Questions & Answers:

[Operator instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Your line is open.

Sterling Auty -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst

Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. I didn't know I could actually make comment.

I would have prepared some remarks for you. Maybe just to get started, let's talk about the education vertical in particular. Can you give us a sense of what was the mix of products that you saw most in demand? You had given some anecdotal highlights, but what are you seeing in terms of the uptake in the product portfolio, specifically to education? And can you give us a sense of what was the education mix as a percentage of either bookings or revenue, whichever you feel comfortable giving?

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

What I'll do is I'll just comment a little bit about products. Thanks, Sterling, by the way for the question and for joining us. And then I'll kick it over to Jill for the mix. So on products, you'll recall that our cross-sell products of Jamf Protect and Jamf Connect are the primary cross-sell products we have.

Those to date have been mostly selling within commercial markets. So, therefore, the bookings that are occurring within education are either for the Jamf Pro product or the Jamf School product. And both in Q3 just performed extremely well as educators around the world have diverse needs, and one of those solutions seems to fit each customer's needs uniquely. So both performed very, very well worldwide.

Jill Putman -- Chief Financial Officer

As far as the split of where the business comes from between commercial and education, Sterling, not to dissimilar to our run rates, however, education was a little bit heavier than a typical Q3 because of the kind of the tail end of some of the COVID-related distance learning spend. But because revenues driven by the ARR, the revenue split continues to be in the range of 60% commercial, 40% education.

Sterling Auty -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst

All right. Great. And then in terms of follow-up, how should we think about 5G in the way that Apple is starting to incorporate them into their devices? And as we think about, M1 chip and maybe a 5G-enabled iPad, how do you expect that to impact enterprise adoption and ultimately Jamf's uptake?

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Very interesting question Sterling. I, for one, think that 5G is transformative, and again different areas of the world were at different spots on and their maturity in that area. And there are some areas of the world that frankly are more keen on 5G connectivity, then Wi-Fi connectivity in some spots.

And I think it has the potential, especially within education to be very transformative. During the pandemic, one of the big concerns has been our students are able to get connected from their homes. We have seen an uptick of LTE-enabled iPads in those situations so that educators could make sure that our students had connectivity from their home. And again, these will be school-issued iPads.

I think with the emergence of 5G on its way, it could potentially be very transformative to both education and in commercial markets to just have connectivity all the time. That's very, very fast.

Sterling Auty -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst

Makes sense. Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.

Unknown speaker

Hi. This is RJ on behalf of Rod. Thanks for taking my question. And congrats on the solid results.

Could you give us an update on your pipeline and the demand trajectory you're seeing? And based on your conversations with customers, how long do you expect this favorable environment to persist? And I have a follow-up.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Thank you for the question. So the question being about the pipeline, we are seeing a type of pipeline coverage that is very similar to what we would have expected to see had a pandemic not occurred. We're very confident in our pipeline coverage.

And again, from a total coverage perspective, it's about the same as what we would have expected and what we've experienced in the past. As a matter of fact, at this moment, it's a little bit stronger than it's been over say the course of the last six months or so. The difference is a little bit of the mix. We see, obviously, tremendous strength in education, so it's a little bit stronger than normal.

But overall, it's about what we would expect. And as we go forward, we don't have visibility to a time where that's really changing. Again, what we've noticed more than anything as the pandemic has progressed or the time period has progressed is the mix from geography or an industry might shift, but the overall value remains roughly about what we would have expected.

Unknown speaker

And as a follow-up, when can we expect Jamf's Connect and Jamf Protect for IOS? And could you also give us an update on your plans to target any other adjacent markets? Thank you.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

So on Jamf Connect and Jamf Protect, you are correct, that they are designed today for macOS. And I would just say that it is within our strategic intent to be able to add our access management and identity capabilities and endpoint security capabilities eventually on the other Apple devices like iOS an iPadOS. I have nothing to announce in terms from a timing perspective, but strategically you're right in line of what we would intend to do going forward. From a market perspective, there are a couple of ways of answering that.

One would be from a geographic standpoint. One of the markets that is emerging for us this year has been Latin America and we're very excited about its potential in the future, although it's very young for us. Other markets that we launched into a few years ago like Japan are performing extraordinarily well. Japan was very much a highlight for us in Q3.

When it comes to industries, it's going to be those industries, especially that remote work is supported that we're going to do extraordinarily well in, and then also industries where iOS devices have a transformative ability to sit between customer and the provider in order, one, to keep people safe, but also just to have a more efficient workflow. Those are going to be the markets that we're going to do best in.

Unknown speaker

Great. Thanks, guys.

Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line from Bhavan Suri from William Blair. Your line is open.

Bhavan Suri -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

Thank you. Hey, Dean. Hey, Jill. Congrats.

Nice job there. I guess I want to touch a little bit on two things. One is we've always seen some great news about the progress of the vaccine, but we've also seen cases spike and potential lockdowns in Europe, certainly, and then potentially in the US. You've had some deals pushed, deal cycles extended, and obviously offset by some traction.

I'm not talking about the quarter, but as you look forward, how are you thinking about the business given that environment? Do you think that we end up going back to what happened in March, April, May? Or do you think that actually we've sort of gone around that we understand how this works? And we might be able to kind of see those pipelines, you just mentioned, Dean, so we actually play out a little faster with less delays. How should we think about what you're thinking about and modeling for the future so strategically?

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. So thanks, Bhavan, for your question. Well, I wish I could predict the future. I wish I had that talent that pertains to the pandemic.

I'm not there.

Bhavan Suri -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

You don't have a crystal ball?

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. But I will remind you that one of the interesting things with Jamf is, I mean, we're really tracking on the year about where we would have predicted to be last January 1. We just ended up getting there a different way. In this particular case, diversity is our friend, diversity in industry and diversity in geography, so that even if there are certain areas of the business that are down, others for completely different reasons are up.

As we've mentioned before, we see the same economic headwinds as do everyone else, but we've got these great tailwinds like telehealth and distance learning, and work from home that have really benefited our business. And going forward, frankly, I can look at areas of the business that will strengthen when the pandemic passes, and I will look at areas of the business that will strengthen or should the pandemic persist for a bit. I think more than anything what we've noticed is that the pandemic has awakened industries to what is possible with technology. And we think more than anything, it is actually accelerated the adoption of work from home and industry transformation in such a way that once the headwinds persist, we believe the tailwinds will continue forward.

Bhavan Suri -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

Yes. No. That's helpful. I mean, I think you're probably right there even despite not having the pure crystal ball.

I'd like to touch a little bit around partners. You have a great set of partners, you've got resellers, you've got a whole bunch of interesting relationships where you've engaged, despite the current set of environments. I guess I'd love to saying how you think about investing more there and what back to potentially be as a percentage of revenue long term against not any necessarily guidance, but sort of how you think that plays out of the next three years to five years, given they're so valuable and so well set up to sort of play this game as long as they understand, especially, including, for example, the deeper relationship with Microsoft. So I'd love to understand how you think about that the investments we're making, what that might be as a percentage of revenue? Thanks.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Sure. Thanks again. And there is a couple of different ways to look at partners. Obviously, just channel partners is one of them when it comes to just splits on that, maybe I'll kick that over to Jill to make a few comments.

But overall on partnerships, of course, it's going to be part of our solution consideration. Every single piece of new value that we want to bring to our customers, we are going to make a wise-make partner or buy decision. And in many cases, we're going to be looking for an influential partner that has an excellent solution that could accompany ours as a matter of fact. If you go to marketplace.jamf.com you'll find that we have hundreds of integrations with our development partners out there to bring greater value to our customers.

In addition to those partnerships, of course, we have the very strategic partners, and the two most notable there, of course, are going to be Apple and Microsoft. On the Microsoft front, if you were able to tune into our JNUC Conference at the end of September, we announced some excellent new capabilities along with Microsoft, for instance, iOS Device Compliance that allows customers to choose Jamf for Apple Enterprise Management and Microsoft for everything else and yet still experience all the compliance checking that Microsoft has across their Enterprise and the single pane of glass reporting in inventory that so many organizations want. So we believe that almost all of the devices in an enterprise are either Windows or Apple-based. And so by Microsoft and Jamf working together, we just make things easier for the customer.

Then on channels, Jill, if you want to make a few comments?

Jill Putman -- Chief Financial Officer

So when we think about our indirect versus our direct business outside of the US, already greater than 80% of our business comes to us through the channel. On the Americas side, however, it's around 40%. And you blend that all out, it's about a 50/50 split on a global basis. But if we think about the Americas, we definitely have some opportunity there.

And that is part of our strategy going forward to look for more opportunities for more channel routes to the market.

Bhavan Suri -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

Gotcha. Gotcha. Super helpful. Thanks, guys, and really nice job.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Appreciate it. Thanks, Bhavan.

Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Brad Sills from Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.

Brad Sills -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Oh, great. Hey. Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking my question.

Wanted to ask one on the dollar-based net retention. We're very healthy there in the 117 range. Has the mix of expansion changed at all since you've seen the success here with Connect and Protect more toward kind of product data on in those two categories versus, say device expansion? Any comment you can make on just the balance of what's driving that between devices and add-ons?

Jill Putman -- Chief Financial Officer

As a reminder, our dollar-based net retention expands based on devices and add-on products. So specifically to address your question on the add-on products with Connect and Protect, while Protect is still too new and too immaterial to have an impact, Connect, if you think seize back at our retention rates a year and a half, two years ago, we were in the 115%, and when bringing Connect on, we saw that nice little pop up to about 117% run rate that we've been hovering at. So being able to maintain that, so it's kind of, already, that growth and lifted baked in. And at this point, and then from here on, we'll continue to see some uplift coming from Protect as well.

Brad Sills -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

And wanted to ask about kind of early interest on some of the new vertical solutions you launched at the conference, virtual visits, and assessments, how are those tracking? What's the level of interest there? And what might that due to ASP for customers? Thank you.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Sure, Brad. And just for those are workflows that we've launched in our existing solutions so there -- those are not added back sales, but rather workflows that we've released that we would get the traditional pricing for, for instance, our Jamf Pro product. So we shouldn't be thinking about those products is being add-on sales, but rather part of the expanded device deployment to Jill's point, most of our net retention is because of a device deployment.

So the more that we released workflows that encouraged greater device adoption, we end up growing with the customer because of that. And of those, we launched a virtual visit. I believe it was right around the end of March. It was just very soon after the pandemic broke out.

We had our healthcare customers coming to us and saying, they needed a simple process that would connect patients to either caregivers or their families without the patient having to know how to do anything or set up each individual call. So we are able to get that out there relatively quick because of our electronic medical record systems integration without IT staff ever having to help. So dozens of hospitals within a matter of a month or so started looking at that solution beginning their implementations. On the Assessments app, that is a free app that's available from the App Store.

And that adoption has not taken off quite as much as what you saw with Virtual Visits, but it is really served a few customers extraordinarily well to be able to observe students take a test, especially for some of those college types of preparation tests.

Brad Sills -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Great. Thanks so much, Dean.

Our next question or comment comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open.

Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst

Hey. Thanks. Two questions. Jill, last quarter you talked a little bit about the slightly slower expansion of seats in the commercial space.

Can you talk a little bit about what you saw this quarter? And then on the education side, Dean, would that just typical Q3 thing, back-to-school, etc., or because of COVID do you think there will be kind of follow-on or there will build-in impact Q4 and other quarters as kind of people kind of closed down again and school-home again, etc. Just talk to that dynamic a little bit? Thank you.

Jill Putman -- Chief Financial Officer

When it comes to our commercial device expansion, Q3 looks very similar to Q2 with the exception of at a little bit of a slower start to Q2 because of April. And now as we think about our Q4 pipeline and what we're seeing, we're actually starting to see a little bit of an expansion opportunity there, where there are some of those IT budgets that were frozen or delayed or may be restricted in some capacity because of cash constraints, starting to see some confidence to build back up with our commercial customer base. And so we're hoping to see a little bit of that free back up for us.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Hey, Raimo. On the education side, you're right, that, of course, the buying season for education is very heavily weighted toward June and July, which marks the fiscal year move for educators in the United States. And then also, of course, are preparing for the upcoming school year. And we saw those two months as being as strong as ever, this year.

But the difference this year was that the tail of the education buying season extended into September, much more aggressively than it had before. And there is a couple of reasons for that, one of which is simply the source for funding on those purchases often came through government programs, and sometimes you just took a little bit of work in order to get that going. We are seeing that that tail is extending even further into Q4, which is a little bit unusual compared to past years as well. I actually believe in the next couple of quarters we're going to see an unusual amount of education buying compared to past seasons through the winter.

And I think there are a few reasons for that. One is going to be because Jamf is more global than ever in education. And if you take a look, obviously, not all of them have the exact same buying season as we have here in the US. And we have some countries as I've already mentioned that are doing a national deployment of technology to students and they are still in the very early stages of those deployments.

So we're anticipating that that's going to continue beyond the normal education buying season. And in addition to that, it's really interesting but the pandemic has, as I mentioned a little bit earlier, has almost awake in some industries to the potential that technology can provide. So while some schools had shared technology programs, what they've done just in some isolated cases with the pandemic is realized the potential of one-to-one technology for students. For instance, the hand-raising capability that a student can do from home turns out.

That's pretty valuable in the classroom as well in order to get more students speaking up that they need help. So I think it's going to continue for a while. I think that we're going to see more education buying as a percent of our overall buying this winter than we've seen in past winters.

Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst

OK. Perfect. Congrats from me as well.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.

Matt Hedberg -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Hey, guys. Congrats as well on the acceleration. A little bit of a follow-up to Raimo's question on the strength in education. Our school districts approaching their contracts this year differently with, obviously, elevated levels of at-home.

Or Dean as you suggest is it more a function like this could be the new normal, in other words, even if kids aren't at home, the use of iOS devices in school will sort of permanently be higher than maybe what it once was. Therefore, maybe the contracts are no different than maybe at elevated levels. But you wouldn't necessarily expect that the kind of sort of come bring their seats down, let's say at some point?

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

As far as the contracting goes, I think, a very common method of contracting is actually along with a leasing arrangement that they might have from Apple for the devices themselves. And it's very frequently actually that those leases are for multi-year periods and then they'll buy Jamf to use with them for that same period of time. So that is somewhat common to history, but this year, maybe we are even seeing it more than ever. And no, I don't think we'll ever see on a mass scale that schools go into reverse on the technology front.

I think now that they're leasing these devices for the next several years. That is going to be something that, like I said earlier, has awaken them to the potential. And there are things that you can now think about in education. Of course, we want kids ultimately in the classroom, but even the classroom environment can be helped.

We actually call it technology-enabled active learning, where students aren't just sitting through a lecture, but they're doing something. It's been proven that learning environments can be enhanced with that. And I think more schools are going to realize that. And then, of course, Matt, as you well know, even earlier this week, we might have had a Snow Day in Minnesota under normal circumstances and who knows perhaps snow days will be a thing of the past.

Matt Hedberg -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

I'm sure. If there is kid listening, they probably don't like to hear that, but maybe you're probably right. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, I think, you said Jamf Business Plan, which to me sounds like a bundled offering of multiple products. I'm just sort of curious is that the right way to think about that in terms of trying to sell sort of more products through a bundle into the basin, maybe make it easier to consume and price? Is that the right way to think about that?

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. We are seeing just a terrific early demand for both Jamf Connect and Jamf Protect. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks that just since the COVID outbreak, over 700 customers of Jamf Connect are new to that solution, over 200 customers of Jamf Protect, and this is the first year that we have the solution available. So what we're hearing from customers is they just want it to be easier to work with us and to buy those solutions and renew those solutions.

So we've come up with, you're right, a bundled offer called Jamf Business Plan, where we're putting Jamf Pro, Jamf Protect, Jamf Connect altogether for all of the users of devices, whether it'd be just Mac or whether it would be iOS as well, on a usage-based pricing offer. Super easy to buy super easy to renew just based on headcount.

Matt Hedberg -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

That's great. Well, I do see great opportunity to cross-sell. Great. That's it for me.

Thanks, guys. Congrats again.

Our next question or comment comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is open.

Gregg Moskowitz -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst

OK. Thank you very much. Hi, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter.

So a bit of a follow-up to Raimo's question. You added, in total 1.4 million devices under management this quarter. And I think that's the strongest quarterly performance for Jamf that we've ever seen. And I know that you don't, of course, guide to incremental devices under your management on a go-forward basis.

But it sounds like Dean that just following your comments, specifically around education and sort of the longer-tail that exists, it sounds like you don't sort of look at any kind of cliff event if you will, where you might see-now that we sort of exit this back-to-school period you might see this kind of material degradation and incremental unit. It sounds like the demand drivers seem pretty solid for a little while, but I just wanted to follow up on that.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Absolutely, I do not see what's happening right now as a pull-forward or a temporary action. I actually see it as more of an accelerator to what technology can be used for in the future. And a lot of organizations are thinking kind of differently about their spend. I mean, think about it this way.

Of course, we know the work at home and learn-from-home initiatives are igniting some of this activity. But some organizations are realizing, hey, you know what, we don't have to spend as much on travel as we have historically spent provided that people have excellent technology to where they don't have to travel, or maybe we don't have to grow our facilities as fast as we did before provided that people have an excellent technology environment that is their office at home. And then in many industries, as I mentioned as well, in order to be safe and stay open should whatever happens in the future, put technology between the customer and the consumer, between the teacher and the student, between the patient and the doctor, between the store retailer and the shopper. You can go through industry-by-industry and realize how not only would that help keep people safe and help keep organizations open, but it will actually make those organizations more efficient in the long run, and I believe that what we've experienced in the last six months has really shown organizations that.

And then just as a follow-up, getting back to JNUC, which, by the way, was one of the best virtual conference introduction I've seen. And I know the number of attendees that you talked about was much higher than usual, but, of course, there is no physical interaction, right. And so I'm just curious if you've seen any change in the top of funnel versus what you typically experience after this event. Thanks.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks a lot, Gregg. And I appreciate the compliment and we're so proud of what our marketing team put together. But it's really an entire company event. I would remind you that the core purpose of JNUC is to be an educational event where Apple admins can collaborate and learn.

And this year was no different. We didn't want it to be a marketing event. We wanted it to be an education event. However, what we did discover is when you take cost and travel out of the equation, we are able to see exactly how many people really want to come to JNUC.

And as we mentioned was approximately 20,000 attendees, 10 times what typically is, with 28% of them being prospects. So while it's an education event, yes, some people come to plan their future investments. We've already seen leads come out of it. And we're expecting more of that activity because of the very large attendance that we had.

Gregg Moskowitz -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst

Terrific. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of David Hynes from Canaccord. Your line is open.

David Hynes -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst

Hey, Dean and Jill. Congrats on the nice quarter. Dean, maybe I could ask one about Protect. You noted a nice win with SAP.

I think it's been a customer for a while. So I guess, I'm curious kind of what was the catalyst to get SAP to kind of act and take on Protect? What's the early feedback been from them? And then when you talk about 28,000 Protect licenses, is that just a portion of their Mac base? Is there still an opportunity to grow there? Just kind of how are they thinking about the rollout?

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks for joining and thanks for the question. So two questions there. One is just about SAP's rollout. And yeah, they've been pretty open that they're up to about 28,000 Mac.

And that is their Mac fleet. But SAP continues to grow their Mac fleet every year. As do so many of our customers as Mac continues to gain popularity within the enterprise. And especially with Apple's announcements this week, we do not see that going away anytime soon as a matter of fact we see especially with the announcements this week.

And today's general availability of Big Sur, we think that that is going to continue to grow. When it comes to feedback on protect, there have been some really terrific testimonials that have come in that I'm sure our marketing team will get busy on making sure that we make that information public. But the biggest thing that we've noted with our early installations is that our customers have been putting Jamf Protect out there for their Macs. And almost instantly finding things that they wish they would have known about those Macs that the past security software that was, let's face it, predominantly Windows-focused, simply didn't find.

And this is because we look specifically for Mac exploits whether their behaviors or whether it'd be malware because of our Apple-specific focus, they are finding things on their Macs that they wish they would have known ahead of time. And the user experience is still excellent because we actually have an architected for Mac solution.

David Hynes -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst

And then maybe a follow-up on the healthcare segment, which I don't think we've talked about. Yeah, just the dynamics there, I'm curious, when you land a customer in that segment do you tend to land more expanded? In other words, is a hospital system typically like hey we're in Apple organizations, so you get a bunch of devices upfront, or is there still that device penetration story that we might see kind of play out more in the enterprise market?

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

It's the latter. It is not a go in and win all devices, all types on the very first day. As a matter of fact almost more so in healthcare occurs over time because it's very frequent that let's face it. For healthcare providers out there, if they have Mac, they are more than likely using Jamf already.

And so it will be a step forward to say, hey, I've heard of what Jamf's doing either with clinical communication or patient bedside or Virtual visits. I think I would like to try that in a pilot. And then they roll out in a pilot. After that, they might roll it out to an entire ward, after that maybe an entire hospital.

And then, of course, many integrated healthcare networks have many hospitals under their management, so they'll roll out hospital by hospital. So health is very frequently a start smaller and just continues to grow the industry.

David Hynes -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst

Interesting. OK. Great. Thanks for the color.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Pat Walravens from JMP Securities. Your line is open.

Pat Walravens -- JMP Securities -- Analyst

Oh, great. Thank you, and congratulations. So one question for each of you if that's OK. Dean, first, I enjoyed your conversation with Jeremy Butcher on Jamf Nation.

And between that and the fact that it's been six months since Apple bought Fleetsmith, I just wonder if there is anything new that you've learned about their thinking behind that acquisition. I know that's something that some investors were worried about.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Sure. Thanks, Pat, and I'll pass on your thoughts to our good friend Jeremy at Apple. The short answer is no. There has really been nothing more significant that has happened around that acquisition hasn't changed the competitive dynamic at all.

And the way that our viewpoint of it in the last earnings call and our viewpoint of it several months ago, when we first talked about, it is the same as it is today anything that increases Apple's usage in the enterprise is great news for Jamf. And we don't really compete with that particular solution at all, and that we believe it's ultimately going to be used, and those talented individuals are going to be used at Apple just to continue to strengthen Apple's cloud services that Jamf will then be able to leverage to build stronger solutions for our customers.

Pat Walravens -- JMP Securities -- Analyst

And then, Jill, I know you very clearly have not guided to it. But I'm just wondering if there's any thoughts you would want to share with investors about things they ought to think about when they look at 2021?

Jill Putman -- Chief Financial Officer

And no. Clearly, we have not guided to '21 when we have. But I think the thing we can think about is this is an unusual year. So as we exit this year, we're going to have a different exit rate than we maybe would have had on our expense base.

But our revenues are right in line with where we are expecting them to be as we exited the year. We'll continue to invest at rates that were very similar to kind of, you think about our pre-COVID expense investment levels, particularly on the go-to-market energy and where we put dollars there and continuing to invest at a rate very consistent with prior periods in that we still -- we're early in our opportunity in the TAM. And so we've got a lot of customers to go and grab, and so we'll continue to spend there. And then also continuing to expand or invest at a similar rate in R&D as we continue to innovate on both of our existing and new technologies.

And then probably the only thing that will be slightly different next year is, of course, it will be our first full year as a public company. So we'll have some incremental spend in our G&A and back-office functions there.

Pat Walravens -- JMP Securities -- Analyst

OK. Great. Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Rob Owens from Piper Sandler. Your line is open sir.

Rob Owens -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst

Great. In under the wire. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Dean, you have something little bit in some of your comments.

But with Apple drops major operating systems and hardware updates, what's been performance your business historically? Have you ever seen a step function associated with that, or is this just driving more consumerization, so it's more of a longer-term momentum opportunity?

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Thanks a lot for the question. And this is a big week. It's actually a terrific week.

For those that watched the Apple event earlier this week, not only is the new Mac operating system Big Sur available today but earlier this week, Apple announced that probably the biggest move with the Mac that they've made in a very, very long time where the new MacBooks with the M1 chip are coming available. And really of all the Apple Enterprise Management providers that are out there, only Jamf was here. The last time Apple did something like this when they moved from the PowerPC chip back in 2005 to Intel. And we helped organizations through that.

But as you can imagine, not every single Mac within an enterprise is going to move all on the same day. For a Mac for a couple of years, you're going to have enterprises that have a mix of Intel Macs and M1 chip Macs. And nobody has a larger Mac inventory than does Jamf, and nobody can get to information on the Mac's better than Jamf. And as a result, we're going to be able to help with policy management and security and those types of things for the next couple of years for organizations.

And of course, the thing that really distinguishes Jamf is that, while there are companies out there right now saying they're nervous about their customers upgrading to Big Sur, Jamf is a matter of fact, there are Jamf's all around the world today, upgrading to Big Sur without concern because we just know that we're going to work with it. In addition to that, the same goes for the processor. Again, a little anecdotal story on that. And this will kind of reflect what will-why we tend to do well when these changes occur is, I bought my MacBook Air with the M1 chip five minutes after that Apple event was over.

I didn't need to call anybody in IT or anybody in security to find out whether it was OK or whether it would work within our organization. I will get it within a couple of weeks delivered to my home. I'll power it up and I will enroll it in management connection and protection at Jamf, and I will be up and running with all my data from my prior Mac and with all access and security applied inside a 30-minute to moment as to blip. And nobody from IT will be involved and nobody from IT will help me.

That is just a new world of enterprise operations that very few people exist in. And the more organizations we can show that kind of simplicity to, the more Mac adoption with Jamf will grow within the enterprise.

Rob Owens -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst

Perfect. And then regarding some of your earlier channel comments, are there enough channel partners out of scale within the Apple ecosystem to truly drive channel leverage? And if so, what you kind of take on your partners that more opportunistic on more of 1G, 2G basis? Thanks.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

I mean, well, there are obviously some major channel partners out there because, of course, as you know, in the enterprise Apple devices sell entirely through the channel. And so those organizations, a lot of times organizations just want to have their management in security and access controls purchased right along with the devices, and so they'll go on one order form into these large resellers. Of course, we're also going to have regional resellers around the world going to market, but it's a mix. In total, Jamf's have got hundreds of resellers that we work with.

But of course, we've got the top five or six that represent a very good chunk of the selling.

Operator

Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Dean Hager for any closing remarks.

Dean Hager -- Chief Executive Officer

Sure. Thanks, everybody, for joining today. We really appreciated the questions. I'm so proud of what the Jamf team members have accomplished in Q3.

And we look forward to continue to help organizations succeed with Apple in the future, no matter what the future holds. Now go out there and buy your new MacBook with the M1 chip. You won't regret it. Stay safe and be well.

Thanks.

3 5G Stocks That Also Pay Rock-Solid Dividends,Motley Fool,5 days ago,"Apple's recent launch of the iPhone 12, its first 5G smartphone, will inevitably boost Skyworks' sales. Wireless connections across a city. Image source: Getty ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/13/3-5g-stocks-which-also-pay-rock-solid-dividends/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Many wireless carriers have been expanding their fifth-generation (5G) networks, which can transfer data up to 100 times faster than 4G networks, over the past year. The growth of that market could pave the way for breakthroughs across the mobile, Internet of Things (IoT), automation, analytics, and artificial intelligence markets.

As a result, the global 5G services market could grow at a whopping compound annual growth rate of 43.9% between 2021 and 2027, according to Grand View Research. Investors who want a piece of that action have plenty of stocks to choose from, but only a handful of those companies pay dividends.

Let's take a closer look at three companies that will profit from the growth of the 5G market while paying decent dividends to patient investors: Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).

What does the 5G market means to these three companies?

Before we discuss these companies' dividends, we should see how the 5G market's secular growth will boost their revenues and earnings.

Ericsson controlled 14% of the world's telecom equipment market last year, according to Dell'Oro Group, putting it in third place behind Huawei's 27% share and Nokia's (NYSE:NOK) 16% share. Ericsson is arguably the strongest of the top three players.

Huawei faces blacklists and sanctions. Nokia is dealing with sluggish network upgrades, tough competition in China, and a recent CEO change. Ericsson isn't struggling with any management issues, it's growing faster than Nokia in China, and it's already signed 116 commercial 5G agreements or contracts with unique operators worldwide.

Skyworks produces wireless chips for the mobile, automotive, home automation, wireless infrastructure, and industrial markets. Its top customer is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which accounted for 51% of its revenue last year. Apple's recent launch of the iPhone 12, its first 5G smartphone, will inevitably boost Skyworks' sales.

But that's not all: Skyworks expects industry-wide front-end chip revenue to hit $25 per 5G smartphone, up from $18 per 4G device and $8 per 3G device. Those content share gains, along with Skyworks' expansion into non-smartphone markets, make it a top 5G play.

Qualcomm is the world's top manufacturer of wireless modems, which it integrates into its industry-leading Snapdragon system on chips (SoCs) for mobile devices. It also owns the world's largest portfolio of wireless patents, which entitles it to a cut of every smartphone sold worldwide.

Those two core businesses make Qualcomm the unofficial gatekeeper of the 5G market. Most of the world's 5G smartphones will be powered by Qualcomm's SoCs, and every original equipment manufacturer (OEM) -- even those that don't use Qualcomm's chips -- will need to pay it 5G licensing fees.

How healthy are their dividends?

When investors research a company's dividend, they should focus on three things: the company's cash dividend payout ratio, or the percentage of its free cash flow paid out as dividends over the past 12 months; its forward dividend yield; and its track of record of annual dividend hikes.

Company Cash Dividend

Payout Ratio Forward

Dividend Yield Consecutive Years

of Dividend Hikes Ericsson 26.4% 1.4% 1 Skyworks 38.1% 1.4% 6 Qualcomm 65.4% 1.8% 1

Ericsson pays semi-annual dividends, which are set every year based on its profits instead of regular year-over-year increases. Skyworks and Qualcomm both pay quarterly dividends.

Qualcomm finally raised its dividend earlier this year after a two-year freeze. During that time, it prioritized big buybacks over dividends after it abandoned its takeover of NXP and narrowly fended off a hostile takeover attempt by Broadcom.

Skyworks has consistently raised its dividend every year since its introduction in 2014. All three companies have plenty of room to raise their dividends in the future, and none of them suspended their payouts during the COVID-19 crisis.

Are these stocks cheap relative to their growth?

Investors should take analysts' forecasts with a grain of salt, but all three companies are expected to generate solid revenue and earnings growth next year as the 5G market expands. All three stocks are also reasonably valued relative to those near-term forecasts, but Ericsson looks the cheapest:

Company Revenue Growth,

Next Fiscal Year EPS Growth,

Next Fiscal Year Forward

P/E Ratio Ericsson 7% 24% 16 Skyworks 9% 14% 19 Qualcomm 7% 11% 22

The key takeaway

Ericsson, Skyworks, and Qualcomm probably won't impress serious income investors, but their dividends present a nice bonus for investors who are willing to patiently wait for the 5G market's tailwinds to kick in.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.167, 'neu': 0.833, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.1027}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.847, 'pos': 0.153, 'compound': 0.4019}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.847, 'pos': 0.153, 'compound': 0.4019}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.13396666666666665,-0.1027,0.13396666666666665,0.05507777777777776,Neutral,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Negative,Somewhat Positive
Is Now a Good Time to Build an ESG Portfolio?,Motley Fool,6 days ago,"The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft and recommends the following options: long January 2021 $85 calls on Microsoft, ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/esg-investing/2020/11/12/is-now-a-good-time-to-build-an-esg-portfolio/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","The financial community has been abuzz about ESG funds, which have shown a surprising level of strength in recent years. And now, with a President-elect who supports sustainability waiting in the wings, the time could be right to build out a broader ESG portfolio -- as long as you understand the risks.

A bright ESG outlook

It wasn't too long ago that you didn't have the option to build a well-diversified ESG portfolio. You might have held a clean energy fund out of principle, but you also had to own positions that rated lower on ESG factors just to have a sufficient level of diversification.

Not so today. The ESG fund space has grown dramatically in recent years to the point that it may check all the boxes on your portfolio's target asset allocations -- including emerging markets, international developed markets, domestic large and mid caps, real estate, and domestic and international fixed income.

And now, with President-elect Joe Biden on his way to the White House, ESG investing will likely continue to flourish as it benefits from a more favorable regulatory environment going forward. As a starting point, Biden is expected to rejoin the Paris climate deal and reenact federal initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. More than that, Biden and running mate Kamala Harris are also likely to enact policies that go beyond the ""E"" in ESG, policies that encourage responsible corporate social and governance practices as well.

What happens next

While analysts largely agree that ESG funds will do well under a Biden-Harris administration, there's always the question of what happens next. Yes, Biden and Harris will likely swing the regulatory pendulum to support sustainability. But that pendulum could very well swing back the other way in four or eight years. It could even happen at the hands of Donald Trump, who's rumored to be considering a run at the 2024 election.

If you are investing for the long haul, it's always risky to overhaul your portfolio based on a four-year window of opportunity. Once you start making investing decisions based on who's in the White House, it becomes difficult to stop. You could find yourself in a perpetual state of trying to predict what will happen under this administration or the next. That's not a good place to be, emotionally or financially. You'll end up riding a stress rollercoaster every four years and, if you act on your predictions, you might inadvertently lower your investment returns, too.

Take a measured approach

If sustainability is important to you, it's appropriate to increase your exposure to companies with strong ESG initiatives and track records, either directly or through ESG funds, with a caveat. You're not making these moves as a strategy to get rich while Biden is president -- you're making them because they're right for you long term. You can stick to the long-term approach by remaining disciplined about how you choose your ESG positions.

When selecting individual stocks, for example, evaluate the business model, leadership team, industry dynamics, financial strength, and cash flow, in addition to the ESG ratings.

To evaluate ESG funds, take care to understand the fund's screening process. The presence of ESG, clean energy, or sustainability in the fund's name doesn't mean much. Dig in and find out how companies are selected for the portfolio. Review the holdings carefully, too, to ensure you aren't overexposed to companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. These are popular in both ESG and traditional funds. Check the fund's performance history and also put your eyes on the expense ratio. Expenses for ESG funds can be on the high side relative to traditional funds.

Finally, don't overlook diversification. Focusing your investing on the ESG space naturally limits your diversification. That's not to say you should invest in ExxonMobil to counter that, but just make sure your holdings are spread appropriately across individual companies, asset classes, and even geographies.

Focus on the long term

Building out a broader ESG portfolio may be the right move from the standpoint of your worldview and values. Make sure it's also the right financial move by staying diversified and also disciplined in your selection process. You certainly want to benefit from ESG investing in the short term, but your decisions have to make long-term sense, too.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.756, 'pos': 0.244, 'compound': 0.4404}]","[{'neg': 0.095, 'neu': 0.654, 'pos': 0.252, 'compound': 0.4215}]","[{'neg': 0.095, 'neu': 0.654, 'pos': 0.252, 'compound': 0.4215}]",0.4215,0.4404,0.4215,0.42779999999999996,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive
"What Is a Pure-Play REIT, and Is One Right for You?",Motley Fool,6 days ago,"On the other hand, Apple Hospitality REIT (NYSE: APLE) is a pure play on midlevel hotel real estate. And National Retail Properties (NYSE: NNN) is a pure play ...",https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-investing/articles/what-is-a-pure-play-reit-and-is-one-right-for-you/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Real estate investment trusts (REITs) generally specialize in a certain type of commercial property, but that doesn't mean they only invest in their core property type. For example, many office REITs also have some retail space in their portfolio. Some indoor mall REITs also have some shopping center assets.

Companies that invest exclusively in a certain type of asset are referred to as pure plays. For example, a pure-play shopping center REIT would only own shopping centers and no other kinds of assets.

Pure-play vs. 'focused' REIT examples

As mentioned, many REITs focus on a specific property type. For example, Ryman Hospitality Properties (NYSE: RHP) primarily owns group-focused hotels, Realty Income's (NYSE: O) focus is on freestanding retail properties, and Empire State Realty Trust (NYSE: ESRT) largely owns urban office space.

But none of these are pure plays. In addition to its hotels, Ryman gets a small portion of its revenue from entertainment venues like the Grand Ole Opry. About 15% of Realty Income's portfolio is made up of office, industrial, and agricultural properties. And like many urban office REITs, Empire State Realty Trust has significant exposure to retail real estate, plus it owns and operates the observatory on top of the Empire State Building.

On the other hand, Apple Hospitality REIT (NYSE: APLE) is a pure play on midlevel hotel real estate. And National Retail Properties (NYSE: NNN) is a pure play on single-tenant retail.

Advantages and disadvantages to pure-play REITs

The main reason to consider a pure-play REIT over one with multiple property types is for a narrow focus. If a company is very good at evaluating, operating, developing, and managing a certain type of property, it can be a net benefit to investors for management to stick to their core competence rather than trying to branch out and create multiple income streams. For example, if National Retail Properties were to announce it was going to start buying medical office buildings, it would negatively affect my opinion of it, since the REIT has such an excellent track record in its core property type.

On the other hand, the downside to a pure-play REIT is the same thing as its key advantage: a laser focus on a single type of commercial real estate. This can be a disadvantage in tough times. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Realty Income's industrial and office properties helped offset the effects of retail closures.

The Millionacres bottom line

There's no perfect answer to the ""pure-play or diversified"" debate, and it depends on the REIT. In my own portfolio, I own some pure plays and some with two or more property types in their portfolio. The bottom line is that a pure play REIT can be an excellent way to invest if the management team is very good at generating superior returns from a single type of property and you're prepared to ride out any cyclicality that comes with such a narrow investment focus. But it's important to evaluate REITs on a case-by-case basis -- a solid, well-run operation is far more important as a long-term investor than a narrow or diversified business focus.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.741, 'pos': 0.259, 'compound': 0.6808}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.806, 'pos': 0.194, 'compound': 0.34}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.741, 'pos': 0.259, 'compound': 0.6808}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.806, 'pos': 0.194, 'compound': 0.34}]",0.5104,0.0,0.5104,0.34026666666666666,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive

The company also turned free cash flow positive in its latest quarter.

This is a small company with a market cap of just over $4 billion, but has cash and equivalents of $651 million. Our experts issued a rare ""Double Down"" Buy alert on this one stock... Learn more.

Shares of digital data platform LiveRamp (NYSE:RAMP) have been off to the races this year. The stock has more than doubled since the market crash in March, so a breather following the most recent quarterly update (for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2020) was in order. But some investors chose to focus on disappointing guidance for the busy holiday shopping period to close out the year. No matter -- I still think this small company has plenty of promise in the years ahead.

Riding an economic rebound during the summer months

While the economy overall is still a mess in the wake of the economic lockdown back in the spring, all things digital are doing just fine. As for LiveRamp specifically, many of its customers were affected by the sharp downturn, but have enjoyed resurgent growth lately as organizations quickly adapt to the new digital era that is dawning. This showed up in the numbers for the company's fiscal 2021 second quarter that were reported earlier this week.

Metric Three Months Ended

Sept. 30, 2020 Three Months Ended

Sept. 30, 2019 Change Total revenue $104.7 million $90.14 million 16% Total gross profit margin 66.7% 54% 12.7 pp Net income (loss) ($23.97 million) ($40.20 million) N/A Adjusted EBITDA $3.892 million ($15.90 million) N/A

The results handily beat management's previous guidance for revenue to be $100 million, and fast progress toward unadjusted break-even is also a positive. So why have shares tumbled by double-digit percentages since the report? Because of the company's guidance, specifically an anticipated slowdown in growth in the current quarter. The stock had gotten ahead of itself leading up to the quarterly update, and LiveRamp expects revenue to increase just 11% year-over-year in the final months of 2020. The company habitually under-promises and over-delivers, but a pullback was nonetheless inevitable.

There is still lots of promise for this small technologist, though. It isn't the fastest-growing digital data name around, but with a market cap of only $4.2 billion and trading for just 10 times trailing 12-month sales, I'm interested in adding to my position. Here's why.

1. Data privacy changes favor LiveRamp's platform

Digital data privacy has been a big concern, and it seems the issue is coming to a head. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is making changes to its operating system to eliminate third-party cookies that track user behavior, and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) are already in force. Big tech has been in regulators' crosshairs for a while now. LiveRamp has a solution that works as data practices get updated. In fact, LiveRamp's data-neutral tech was recently selected by The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) to power its advertising ecosystem, and LiveRamp claims its Authenticated Tracking Solution (ATS) works better than traditional tracking cookies anyway.

Other tech platforms like Magnite (NASDAQ:MGNI) have made similar comments regarding data privacy changes being a long-term tailwind. As big tech adapts, LiveRamp will have the opportunity to make further headway.

2. Don't ignore the bottom-line

Revenue growth may be moderating for now at LiveRamp, but there are other factors at work that will push the stock higher. Though it still operates at a net loss, LiveRamp has turned free cash flow positive -- revenue minus cash-only operating and capital expenditures, basically what gets added to the balance sheet each quarter. At just $5.95 million in the last quarter, it isn't much. However, as LiveRamp adds customers to its data subscription platform and reaches a more efficient scale, increases in profitability could be dramatic. And more cash flowing into the business means more operational flexibility to invest in research and development and to promote growth.

3. Mergers and acquisitions are a real possibility

And speaking of ways to promote growth, LiveRamp says it continues to look at strategic mergers and acquisitions and other partnerships as a primary way to expand. And the company has plenty of headroom to do so. At the end of September, LiveRamp had $651 million in cash and equivalents and zero debt on its balance sheet. That's an ample war chest for such a small business. Paired with fast-improving profitability, this cloud-based digital data platform has lots of opportunity ahead of it.

Not perfect, but plenty of positives

The latest quarterly report wasn't perfect, and the company's revenue growth trajectory is something to keep an eye on here. Nevertheless, there are plenty of positives working in LiveRamp's favor right now.

Lewis Chew -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

All right. Thank you, Jason, and congratulations in advance for the impending arrival of your second child. So good afternoon, everyone. I hope everyone is doing well. Our Q4 revenue was above our guidance, but we are still down on a year-over-year basis and that reflects the ongoing impact of the pandemic. So let's go through the numbers.

Fourth quarter revenue was $271 million, compared to $247 million in Q3 and $299 million in Q4 of last year. Our revenue guidance coming into the fourth quarter was a range of $225 million to $255 million. So compared to guidance, revenues were better than what we projected as we had a true-up of about $25 million in the quarter related to Q3 shipments, which was about $15 million higher than the true-up that we had last quarter, and with most of that improvement coming from TVs and set-top boxes, and PCs.

Total company revenue in Q4 increased sequentially by $24 million compared to Q3, as we benefited from higher unit volumes in TVs, set-top boxes, DMAs and PCs, along with the higher true-up that I just discussed. And all of this was partially offset by lower revenue from mobile due to timing under contracts, and I will discuss that in a second.

Now looking at Q4 on a year-over-year basis, total company revenue is down by $28 million from last year's Q4 and we can attribute that mainly to COVID-19, especially in products and services, which were down by about $20 million or nearly 60% below last year. The composition of Q4 revenue was $257 million in licensing and $14 million in products and services. So let's break down licensing revenue by end market, starting with broadcast.

Broadcast represented about 47% of total licensing in the fourth quarter. Broadcast revenues increased by about 2% year-over-year, helped by the higher true-up related to the Q3 shipments and also driven by higher adoption in TVs and set-top boxes. And then this was then offset partially by lower recoveries in the quarter. On a sequential basis, broadcast was up by about 35% due to higher volume in TVs and set-top boxes along with higher recoveries and the higher true-up.

Mobile. Mobile represented approximately 15% of total licensing in Q4. Mobile was down by about 13% over last year due to lower recoveries, but partially offset by higher adoption of Dolby Technologies. For the sequential comparison, I should point out that last quarter Q3, Mobile was about 33% licensing, which was higher than normal, and that was due to timing of revenue under customer contracts, so we came into Q4 expecting Mobile revenue to decline this quarter and return to a more normalized percentage of revenue, which is what it did. So accordingly Mobile revenue was down sequentially by about 50%, and that was primarily due to timing of revenue under customer contracts.

Consumer electronics represented about 13% of total licensing in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, CE licensing was down by about 8%, mainly due to lower recoveries. On a sequential basis, CE was about 68% higher than Q3. And as a reminder, Q3 was lower than usual and only 9% of licensing because of timing under contract. And so, the sequential increase from Q3 to Q4 was mostly a return to a more normal level.

PC represented about 12% of total licensing in Q4. PC was higher than last year by about 26%, helped by the higher true-up and also because of the increased adoption of Dolby Technologies. And sequentially, PC was up by about 32% that's for similar reasons.

Other markets represented about 13% of total licensing in the fourth quarter and they were down by about 19% year-over-year due to significantly lower Dolby Cinema box office share and that's because of the COVID restrictions and lack of big titles, and also because of lower revenues from gaming due to console life cycles and/or recoveries in automotive. On a sequential basis, other markets was up by about 32%, driven by higher revenue from gaming and from via admin fees and that's the patent pool that we administered.

Beyond licensing, our products and services revenue was $14.3 million in Q4, compared to $11.8 million in Q3 and $34 million in last year's Q4. Our guidance had anticipated the large year-over-year decrease because most of this revenue comes from equipment that we sell to cinema exhibitors and these customers continue to be negatively affected by the pandemic.

And speaking of products and services revenue, going forward into Q1, we're winding down and exiting conferencing hardware sales, as we will now be fully focused on expanding the availability of the Dolby Voice experience through software solutions, such as interactivity APIs on our developer platform. So later on, when I cover the outlook for FY '21, my comments on products and services revenue and gross margin will reflect the fact that we are exiting the conferencing hardware arena.

Now I'd like to discuss Q4 margins and operating expenses. Total gross margin in the fourth quarter was 84.3% on a GAAP basis and 85.1% on a non-GAAP basis. Products and services gross margin on a GAAP basis was minus $15.5 million in the fourth quarter and a large portion of that consisted of charges for excess and obsolete inventory associated with conferencing hardware and that relates back to what I just said a minute ago, about our plans in that space.

Going forward into Q1, we anticipate that products and services margin will still be negative, but more along the lines of around minus $3 million or minus $4 million. I'll cover this again in the outlook section in a few minutes. Products and services gross margin on a non-GAAP basis was minus $14.1 million in the fourth quarter, and my comments here are similar to what I just said for GAAP gross margins.

Operating expenses in the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis were slightly above the high-end of the range that we had guided, coming in at a $198.7 million, compared to $182.9 million in Q3. And remember that Q3 was particularly low for us, because that was the first full quarter of reacting to COVID-19 and lots of our activities have been temporarily halted or pushed out. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter on a non-GAAP basis were $176.5 million, which is within our range and that was compared to $159.2 million in the third quarter, and basically the same comments that I made in GAAP apply here as well.

Operating income in the fourth quarter was $30.1 million on a GAAP basis or 11.1% of revenue, compared to $51.2 million or 17.1% of revenue in Q4 of last year. Operating income in the fourth quarter on a non-GAAP basis was $54.3 million or 20% of revenue, compared to $77.6 million or 26% of revenue in Q4 of last year.

Income tax in Q4 was 21.8% on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The effective tax rate was slightly higher than guidance, and that was due mainly to the mix of our income between different tax jurisdictions.

Net income on a GAAP basis in the fourth quarter was $26.8 million or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to $43.9 million or $0.43 per diluted share in last year's Q4. Net income on a non-GAAP basis in the fourth quarter was $45.8 million or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $67.6 million or $0.66 per diluted share in Q4 of last year.

For both GAAP and non-GAAP, net income in Q4 was above the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the quarter, and that was primarily due to revenue being above the high-end of our range, offset partially by the lower product and services gross margin that I mentioned a minute ago.

During the fourth quarter, we generated about $113 million in cash from operations, which compares to about $130 million generated in last year's fourth quarter. We ended the fourth quarter with nearly $1.2 billion in cash and investments.

During Q4, we bought back about 640,000 shares of our common stock and ended the quarter with about $187 million of stock repurchase authorization still available to us. We also announced today a cash dividend of $0.22 per share. The dividend will be payable on December 4, 2020 to shareholders of record on November 24, 2020.

Before I go into the outlook for FY '21, let's summarize the results for the full-year FY '20. Total revenue in FY '20 was $1,162 million that compares to $1,241 million in the prior year with a year-over-year decline due to the impact from COVID-19. Within total revenue, licensing was $1,079 million, which was down about $28 million from last year due to lower consumer activity because of the pandemic, while products and services revenue was $83 million for the year, down about $51 million from last year due mainly to lower demand from the cinema industry because of restrictions brought on also by the pandemic.

Operating income for the full-year FY '20 was $219 million on a GAAP basis or about 19% of revenue and operating income on a non-GAAP basis was $318 million or about 27% of revenue. Net income on a GAAP basis was $231 million or $2.25 per diluted share and net income on a non-GAAP basis was $305 million or $2.97 per diluted share. And cash flow from operations for the full-year was $344 million and that's slightly up from the previous year, where cash flow from operations was $328 million.

So now let's discuss the full-year outlook. First, let me say that we'll be facing some interesting dynamics in FY '21 with our year-over-year comparisons. Because we have a September year-end, the first two quarters of FY '20 were mostly unaffected by COVID-19, while the last two quarters of FY '20 were fully affected by COVID. And as we head into FY '21, COVID continues to persist and visibility is very limited, even more so the further out you tried to look.

So today, I'm going to provide an outlook scenario for the first half of the year, including our perspective on what Q1 and Q2 revenue could be and for the second half of the year because visibility is limited, we are not providing guidance at this time, but I will provide some color on some of the factors that could affect the second half.

So let's discuss the first half. In the first half of FY '21, we currently anticipate year-over-year growth in licensing revenue, and that could be offset by year-over-year decline in products and services revenue. The anticipated growth that we could get in licensing would come mainly from higher adoption of our technologies as industry analysts currently are projecting market TAM to be flat to slightly down in the first half.

And also, we anticipate Dolby Cinema licensing revenue to be significantly down year-over-year in our first half because of that COVID versus pre-COVID factor of comparison in the cinema industry. And then for that same reason, we are anticipating cinema product sales to be down year-over-year.

Now within the first half of the year, based on what we currently see, here is the scenario we are assuming for Q1 and then Q2. In the first quarter of FY '21, we anticipate that total revenue could range from $330 million to $360 million. Within that, we estimate that licensing could range from $320 million to $345 million, while products and services is projected to range from $10 million to $15 million. At the midpoint of the range, we anticipate growth in lights seem to be driven by a higher adoption of our technologies across a range of devices.

In addition, the Q1 licensing outlook is benefiting from timing of revenue under customer contracts, as well as potentially higher recoveries. Now we are not anticipating as much revenue from these items, namely the timing of the recoveries in our second quarter. And by the way, last year, it was Q2 not Q1 that benefited more from timing of recoveries.

So with that in mind, and based on what we currently see and having just gone over the Q1 revenue outlook, we currently see our Q2 revenue scenario looking like a range of about $270 million to $300 million. And doing the math for you on the first half of FY '21 by combining the Q1 and Q2 figures that I just went over, our current outlook scenario assumes a first half FY '21 revenue range of $600 million to $660 million. We will plan to update you on how this picture has evolved after Q1 is completed.

As for the second half, like I said, we are not giving guidance for the second half, but here are some points to consider. On a sequential basis in our licensing revenue, we typically see second half revenue is lower than the first half because of lower seasonality in consumer device shipments and also because of the timing of revenue on the customer contract.

On a year-over-year basis, while we do expect to see continuing benefit from increased adoption of Dolby Technologies, it's worth noting that with respect to market TAM, current industry analysts reports are projecting markets like PC and TV TAM to be down on a year-over-year basis in the second half. And that's because of an uptick in unit shipments that happened in the latter part of FY '20 that might not repeat in that same timeframe next year. So, of course, it's much too early to know if that will be true, but that's what the current reports currently suggest.

And as for Dolby Cinema and cinema products, the year-over-year comparison should be favorable in the second half, but we don't know to what extent or at what pace. So those are a few things to think about for the second half and we thought it was worth providing you that color.

So let me now finish up by providing the outlook on the rest of the P&L for Q1, already highlighted the revenue range scenario of $330 million to $360 million. So Q1 gross margin on a GAAP basis is estimated to range from 90% to 91%, and the non-GAAP gross margin is estimated to range from 91% to 92%. Within that, products and services gross margin is estimated to range from minus $3 million to minus $4 million on a GAAP basis, and from minus $2 billion to minus $3 million on a non-GAAP basis.

As I mentioned earlier, we are winding down and exiting the conferencing hardware space, and the demand for cinema products continues to be weak because of the industry conditions. And as a result, we are reducing certain resources in manufacturing, as well as other areas that were connected with conferencing hardware and cinema products. We anticipate that it will take several months to complete, various activities to smoothly transition our conferencing hardware partners and then customers.

With respect to the impact on our products and services gross margin, we estimate that we could start to see savings in our cost of goods sold by around the end of fiscal Q2, and that's because of these transitioning activities that we have to undertake.

Operating expenses in Q1 on a GAAP basis are estimated to range from $207 million to $219 million. Included in this range is approximately $7 million to $9 million of restructuring charges for severances and related benefits that are being provided to employees that are impacted by the actions that I just mentioned a minute ago. Operating expenses in Q1 on a non-GAAP basis are estimated to range from $175 million to $185 million, and this range excludes the estimated restructuring charge.

Other income is projected to range from $1 million to $2 million for the quarter, and our effective tax rate for Q1 is projected to range from 20% to 21% on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis. So based on a combination of the factors I just covered, we estimate that Q1 diluted earnings per share could range from $0.70 to $0.85 on a GAAP basis and from $0.97 to $1.12 on a non-GAAP basis.

So that's it for me. Over to you, Kevin.

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Thank you, Lewis. And thank you everybody for joining us today. I want to focus my comments on three main areas today. I will start by highlighting our continued progress, increasing the number of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experiences around the world. I'll then spend a few minutes on the changes we have made in our cinema and conferencing hardware business to adjust to the evolving conditions in certain markets. And then I will share some thoughts on the exciting opportunity for Dolby to address a new world of content through our developer platform and related initiatives.

Before we move on, I do want to take a moment to thank our employees for their dedication and creativity. In a year where we all face challenges and disruptions, we have continued to bring more Dolby experiences to more people around the world, and they are the driving force behind the Dolby magic.

So let me start with the Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos ecosystem that continues to grow. With the launch of the iPhone 12, consumers are now able to see the benefits of Dolby Vision when they record video and share it. We are excited about the opportunity to support this ecosystem so the Dolby Vision content can be enjoyed on social media, video sharing sites and more. This will vastly expand the content that can be enjoyed in Dolby Vision, adding more reasons for devices and services to adopt our technology and creating new opportunities for Dolby.

During 2020, we continued to grow the presence of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos across the many ways that people enjoy movie and TV content. At the beginning of the year we saw the launches of Disney+ and Apple TV+ with the combined Dolby experience. Google Play, Showtime and PBS all began streaming in Dolby Vision this year. In this quarter, Watcher a streaming service in Korea began supporting content in Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos.

The momentum of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos within movie and TV content continues to drive an expanding lineup of devices within the home. The adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos within 4K TV shipments grew significantly year-over-year. Our partners like TCL, Sony, Panasonic and Skyworth added support for the Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experience deeper within their TV lineups and have also broadened the global reach of their offerings, including this year into India.

Xiaomi launched their first TV that supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos just this year. And we continue to bring new innovations to market, like Dolby Vision IQ, which optimizes the picture on your TV by adjusting to the surrounding line and to the type of content being viewed. Our continued innovation brings new value to our partners and consumers and adds to the reasons for deeper adoption.

Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos continue to grow across a broader range of devices. Apple recently began enabling support for Dolby Atmos to the HomePod. Earlier this year, Sonos launched its first Dolby Atmos product with the Sonos Arc and Roku began supporting Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos with the Roku Ultra. We are also beginning to see increasing adoption of the combined experience within set-top boxes, including the latest offerings from Free in France and Deutsche Telekom in Germany.

Within Mobile and PC, Apple highlights the adoption of the Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos playback with support throughout their iPad, MacBook and iPhone lineups. We also have strong initial adoption of Dolby Atmos within the latest flagship mobile phones from Samsung, OPPO and Sony. Lenovo launched several new PCs that support the combined experience and Dell began shipping Dolby Vision enabled PCs earlier this year.

We see significant growth opportunities within both Mobile and PC as we gain new wins, drive deeper adoption within our partners' device lineups and expand the types of content that can be enjoyed with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. In the same way, the Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos enabled great movie and TV content, we see a significant opportunity to create immersive experiences within music and gaming. These are important forms of entertainment that expand our current value proposition and grow the number of devices that can benefit from the Dolby experience.

Let me start with music. A year ago, we launched Dolby Atmos for music with Amazon Music HD and the Amazon Echo Studio. The music in Dolby experience has been met with deep and passionate engagement from artists. For example, those that we highlighted in the stories from Lizzo, Post Malone, Coldplay and J Balvin. Tidal became the second streaming service to support Dolby Atmos Music, enabling millions of Dolby Atmos devices within mobile and in the home. Our increasing presence in music will create opportunities to grow adoption in mobile, automotive, smart speakers and headphones.

In gaming, Microsoft announced their new Xbox to be the first gaming console to support the combined Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experience for gaming. We are also seeing a growing number of gaming PCs adopt the Dolby experience, including new products from Lenovo and ASUS this year. As we grow the presence of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos within gaming content, we add to the value proposition for broader adoption within PCs, gaming consoles and mobile phones.

Our momentum for Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos across content, services and devices is strong and at the same time, we still see much of the opportunity ahead of us. We continue to grow our presence throughout devices within the home, and we made it even earlier stages of adoption within mobile and PC. We are focused on accelerating that adoption by increasing the amount of content and by broadening our presence in categories like music and gaming.

Let me shift now to talk about the areas where we have made some changes to adjust to the evolving conditions in certain markets. The cinema environment remains challenging as the time of recovery is uncertain and the landscape is evolving. As Lewis discussed, we have made some adjustments to operations and manufacturing here to reflect a lower outlook for demand. At the same time, we remain confident that studios will continue to create great content that audiences will continue to want to experience these movies in the cinema and that they will take out the best experiences.

Let me spend a few -- just a few moments on Dolby Voice. We entered the communication space with the goal of enabling higher quality and more natural meeting experiences. Our value proposition of enabling higher quality interactions remains as strong and relevant as ever and we see significant opportunities to broaden the reach of our technologies. As we move forward, we are winding down the sales of our conferencing hardware to focus all of our efforts on the larger opportunity to enable the Dolby Voice experience through our enterprise partners and our developer platform.

And that brings me to the opportunity to bring the Dolby experience to the vast and growing amount of content that are a part of our everyday lives, from user-generated content to social media and casual entertainment to everyday virtual interactions.

Today, developers can access our technology through Dolby.io to improve media and interactivity within their applications. We have seen growing engagement from developers across a variety of industries and use cases from improving audio quality in podcast, media production and online marketplace videos to enabling interactivity in online education, social media, and live streaming applications. This quarter, we began partnering with SoundCloud to enable artists to improve the quality of their tracks using our mastering APIs and have seen nearly 200,000 tracks mastered through our APIs in the few months since launch.

We are also working to integrate our media APIs onto the box platform this quarter to enable their customers to enhance content with our media APIs right within the box experience. Additionally, we recently enabled our interactivity APIs to include the benefits of Dolby Voice and we have drawn strong engagement from developers since its release.

As we look ahead, we will continue to expand our offerings to address more audio and video features. For example, now that consumers can create Dolby Vision with the iPhone 12. We see opportunities to support content platforms seeking to make the most of this expanding world of Dolby Vision content. While we are just at the beginning of these new opportunities, we are learning quickly from our early engagement with developers and evolving our offering to bring the Dolby experience to everyday applications and services.

So to wrap up, the momentum of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos with movies and TV content is strong as our partners continue to bring new devices and services to market. Our opportunity remains ahead of us and we are enabling more content experiences in music and gaming that can accelerate the adoption across device categories.

Consumers can now capture and edit in Dolby Vision for the first time, expanding the Dolby experiences into the growing world of user-generated content. And we are excited by the opportunity to bring the Dolby experience to new use cases and industries through our developer platform. All of this gives us confidence in our ability to drive revenue and earnings growth into the future. I look forward to updating you next quarter.

And with that, I will turn it over to Q&A.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steven Frankel with Colliers.

Steven Frankel -- Colliers -- Analyst

Good afternoon, and thanks for the opportunity. Kevin, I want you to talk a little bit about the Dolby.io opportunity. Maybe tell us a little bit about the go-to-market approach. And specifically around voice, how do you take voice, which has so much promise embedded into some higher volume applications, where it can really make a difference to the consumer?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Thanks, Steve. Yeah, we're really excited about the opportunity to improve so many different types of experiences, including the Dolby Voice. And in terms of how we're bringing it to market, we are first focused on our engagement with developers. We've brought a lot of people on board who have a lot of experience doing that, knowing them with the teams that we have that understand how to apply our technology and expertise to improve media and interaction experiences.

So it really is about reaching out to developers, growing that community, bringing them to our platform, make it easy for them to understand how they can employ these technologies, and then also learning from them to then evolve our offerings and bring to bear more of our expertise and more of our IT portfolio to solve new challenges. And of course, over the last six months our product teams have had the opportunity to engage with a lot of potential developers and customers who's really deploying these technologies.

As it relates to Dolby Voice, it's about the interactivity that we experience on our apps and services every day and so that runs across telehealth, online education. We see opportunities in that where entertainment needs communications to work in areas like in the future. We're talking to people about areas like social media or live streaming platforms where people want to introduce interactivity. These are all areas that we see opportunities to bring Dolby Voice to life through the developer platform.

Steven Frankel -- Colliers -- Analyst

And your existing partners like BlueJeans, should we expect them to adopt the software approach as well, so even without your hardware they can get that same experience?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

They do that today, Steve. So BlueJeans has the Dolby Voice service integrated into their full platform. So you do not require the Dolby hardware to get that experience, and we continue to work with BlueJeans and consumers -- BlueJeans customers will continue to enjoy the Dolby Voice experience when they're participating over their mobile devices and their PCs like so many [Indecipherable] are doing for so many hours a day.

Steven Frankel -- Colliers -- Analyst

Great. And you didn't mention anything about gaming given the two new platforms just hitting the market, both of which are sold out. Have you seen that in the numbers in the September quarter or is that coming in the December quarter?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Coming, we're about to go through a refresh cycle. I did touch on it briefly, Steve, but I'm sure you're aware, Xbox is supporting Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos for gaming and we're really excited about that. And so, yeah, of course, the refresh cycle is something that is likely to benefit us in the coming -- these couple of quarters. And gaming is a big area of focus for us across the globe. Certainly, we're focused on making that Xbox experience so successful and a bit of an ecosystem of content as possible. But beyond that, we believe that we can add value in mobile gaming and other areas.

Steven Frankel -- Colliers -- Analyst

And then just one last one. Where do you think your market share is today in Dolby Vision in 4K TVs given that what you're talking about the phenomenon and new geographies and more modest?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yeah. So first of all, Steve, I will say the data is still coming in on that, because, of course, we will get our Q4 reports in the coming weeks and the industry analysts are not quite -- maybe it's not possible there for adapting to this uncertain environment. So the numbers are still coming in, but we're confident that we are going to end up somewhere between 15% and 20% Dolby Vision to 4K TVs and that 4K TVs are probably coming in this last fiscal year for us at somewhere just over 50% of the market.

Steven Frankel -- Colliers -- Analyst

All right. Thank you, Kevin.

Okay. The next question is from -- We'll take our next question from Ralph Schackart with William Blair.

Ralph Schackart -- William Blair -- Analyst

Good evening. First question on the true-up that you called out in the quarter, less than 25 months, a little bit larger than the normal. If you could talk about maybe 15 higher than expected. Any more color on that as 606 are affecting the true-up this quarter?

Lewis Chew -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Sure. And we've been very transparent about this even before we launched 606 that we're going to have this. First of all, I'll reassure you that our processes is very solid, applied very consistently. And the biggest piece of that bump in true-up was new data that we got in on some of the key TAMs in the markets we work on were higher than what had been published at the TAM at the time we did the estimate, and that was across several different categories. So of course, we flow that right through and that affects the number of units that our customers report, because I think I've talked about this in the past that our technique uses interpolation, where we use multiple data points, customer inputs, market share data points and also TAM data. And so the biggest thing driving that uptick in the true-up was an uptick in the TAM there versus what we had [Indecipherable]

Ralph Schackart -- William Blair -- Analyst

Okay. And then we get a lot of questions on the opportunity [Indecipherable] there's obviously a lot of excitement around it, it sounds like you're making great progress in the quarter. Anyway just sort of give us a sense on how to frame this opportunity and put some numbers around it in a range of that's very wide. And if not, just sort of like maybe the building blocks, how to think of potential size on it?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yeah. Obviously, Ralph, let me back up. We do think this is a big opportunity. And for a very long time I might have said that we believe we can improve any audio visual experience and this is what gives us the opportunity to expand that Dolby experience far beyond our traditional realms. We're about six months in, and so right now what we're focused on is engagement with developers. As I think [Indecipherable] we have a number of -- growing number of initial customers that are out there using the platform. And we definitely look forward to providing more data as we go forward here. But we're excited about the customers that we're engaged with and that are coming on right now.

Ralph Schackart -- William Blair -- Analyst

Great. One more, Kevin. Just if you can kind of take a step back and envision at post-COVID world, but hopefully we get too sooner rather than later. Maybe just some updated thoughts on your kind of long-term goal to march back to double-digit growth. We are sort of confident around that prior statement that you're talked about before?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yeah. Well, I feel I'm really pleased with our portfolio of growth opportunities. And I think on the Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos portfolios, we talked about -- we probably have the strongest progress in the living room for movies and TV. I mean, as we just talked about that puts us at about 15% to 20% attached to 4K TVs. We are in even earlier stage with PCs and mobile devices. And we do believe that this focus on additional forms of content, gaming, music are the key to really opening up those opportunities for us. And I think that with Apple embracing the ability to capture, share, edit, content in Dolby Vision, I think that just is the best testament to how the Dolby experience can apply far beyond even those more traditional forms of content. So that's a big growth area.

And then as we talked about -- we're just talking about Dolby.io. So we're really excited about the ability to serve those new markets and new industries, unlocking the creativity of developers with the decades of experience and technology we have in making for the best high quality media and interactions. And so, we do see that as another significant growth opportunity.

Ralph Schackart -- William Blair -- Analyst

Great. Thanks, Kevin. Thanks, Lewis.

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Our next question comes from Paul Chung with JP Morgan.

Paul Chung -- JP Morgan -- Analyst

Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So just on your guidance, as you -- timing of contracts with one of your largest customers just shifting into F-1Q from F-2Q, so are we going to see better relative performance in PCs and Mobile in 1Q?

Lewis Chew -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Well, I stopped sort of giving a breakdown by market because those tend to move around, but yes, this year we do see more of that timing of contracts issue affecting us in Q1 versus last year's in Q2, but for the first half as a whole, it tends to be relatively similar. I should remind you too that, as we roll on as each year goes along, we do get additional customers and get more penetration. So it's not necessarily the same items every year. It's just something we have to live with now under 606. But yes, to your question, Paul, clearly this year we see a little bit more of that benefit from the timing of contract issue falling into Q1 versus Q2 than it did last year, where it fell more into Q2 versus Q1.

Paul Chung -- JP Morgan -- Analyst

Okay. And then secondly, can you talk about the Dolby Vision recording capability on the iPhone? You got a lot of good air time during the event, which is great exposure there. So is there incremental revenue associated with this feature? And are you getting interest from other prominent OEMs kind of looking at this?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yeah. So again, we couldn't be more thrilled to have Apple embrace Dolby Vision for capture and sharing of content. And, obviously, we're not going to get into the specific economics of our relationship with Apple, but I think it does a couple of things for us. One, it again is an amazing example of how Dolby can apply far beyond movies, TV, and even gaming and music.

Secondly, yes, we do think it opens up over time the opportunity to bring that experience to a broader audience. And then third, we think in a world of a large and growing ecosystem of Dolby Vision content in these new areas that there could be some interesting opportunities in some of our newer initiatives to help people get the most out of that content.

Paul Chung -- JP Morgan -- Analyst

Great. Thanks guys. Great job.

Lewis Chew -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

All right, Paul. Thanks.

We'll take our next question from Eric Wold with B. Riley Securities.

Eric Wold -- B. Riley Securities -- Analyst

Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. A couple of questions. A follow-up on kind of always the conversation around Dolby.io. I know it's early, six months in, you are not going to talking about guidance. Is there a way to maybe frame kind of what the average deal size or user size could look like? Or you're trying to think about what the best way to think about the revenue ramp as you gain penetration? Or is it going to be just so many smaller user's revenue flow just that's not the right way to think about it?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Well, as you've said, it's early, but I think we can already see that there will be a pretty broad distribution, right? There will be customers that are certainly in historical Dolby standards are -- might be [Indecipherable] customer. But I think there's also some opportunities to have some reasonably large customers. I think it's all going be about their scale and their use case. So right now where we're seeing early adoption are in areas like improving recorded audio in a number of use cases like SoundCloud, podcasts, [Indecipherable] online platform for the automobile industry for those looking to digitize. So people do videos of the car they are selling and we clean up that audio for them.

So for those customers, the value proposition is a better quality experience. In some cases, saving them time and money on what they were doing to clean it up. And so, the revenue potential is very much a function of the global services and the same is true on the interactivity side. And many of our customers are just kind of -- they're getting hands up and have the potential to grow quite a lot more from where they're today.

Eric Wold -- B. Riley Securities -- Analyst

Okay. And then, last question, obviously, this question you get all the time with a $1.2 billion in cash and no debt and seemingly very strong free cash flow trends do continue. At what point [Indecipherable] there's a need to put that to you to bring home your pocket, but what's the -- that kind of need [Indecipherable] in some manners, obviously you are buying back stock, but there's clearly a limit there to agree. Do acquisitions come more into play, or it's just nothing really inside that can really make a dent in that?

Lewis Chew -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Well, first of all, we regularly review our capital allocation and as you point out, we have also returned cash buybacks and a recurring dividend. I would say that we're always looking for potential acquisitions that could accelerate our business, historically that's tended to be that you might think of as technology tuck-ins. And I think as we go into new areas, that will also open up new opportunities for us to consider. But we'll make those decisions based on where we see opportunities to accelerate and expand the opportunities that we're in pursuit of.

Eric Wold -- B. Riley Securities -- Analyst

Got it. Thank you, guys.

Lewis Chew -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Our next question comes from Jim Goss with Barrington Research.

Jim Goss -- Barrington Research -- Analyst

Thanks. A couple more things on the iPhone 12 capability with the vision capturing. Are you thinking the -- that capability is sufficient for the device we use more for professional content and that -- maybe it might be over to some extent for regular consumers? And also to the extent that you are pretty important to this, potentially to the iPhone 12 sales, do you think Apple is going to use Dolby Vision as one of their marketing capabilities that it's going to be push on it, given what they did do in their own show?

Lewis Chew -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

They could run an ad, Kevin.

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yes. Thanks Jim. So yes, one of the ads Apple has been running besides those I've seen it on stores does in fact highlight the ability to take professional quality video in Dolby Vision. And so to answer your question, it's both, I mean, there are -- many of the -- many themes that you've seen in movies actually have been -- many of them even shot with an iPhone. So the iPhone is a professional device and a consumer device and Dolby Vision brings out the best for both. So it's also a great way to capturing content. I mean, we've been trying it and it's amazing. And it looks more real and like what you experience. And so today you can -- I know at a minimum you can use it in the photos app, you could use it in iMovie, you can use it in the Clips. So we just look forward to supporting clubbing out the ecosystem of apps and services that can support it both for professional use and for consumers.

Jim Goss -- Barrington Research -- Analyst

Okay. And I think Atmos is included on the phones also, can headphones [Indecipherable] and take advantage of the Atmos capabilities? Or do they have to be a specially produced headphones?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Well, for Atmos playback, the iPhone supports iPhone playback, so to say, AirPods Pro. If you're asking about capture, we don't yet have capture, but there's always negative.

Jim Goss -- Barrington Research -- Analyst

Okay. One other thing on the Dolby Cinema installations. China has actually recovered a lot more quickly because of the lockdown capabilities they had. Are you seeing any pick up in the potential for installations to go on there versus other areas which are behind in this spread?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yeah. Well, we certainly had more discussion -- engagement in China, recently we had in many other parts of the world because as you say, they are opened and they've actually had some really good weak's [Phonetic] with local titles. So I would say of the parts of the world where we would still see some nearer term activity in that regard. Yes, China would be among that list. But overall, certainly we expect a lower pace of deployment for Dolby Cinemas screenings and equipment through the -- until we get to the other side of this recovery. But, yes, China is definitely one of the markets that stand out as being better than the others.

Jim Goss -- Barrington Research -- Analyst

Does the vaccine news finally create any higher degree of conversation with the parties you're dealing with for either of US or Europe or elsewhere to create that light at the end of the tunnel where you can start talking again?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Well, I talk to partners in all of the markets and I think none of us know when the industry is going to recover. I mean, obviously most of our screens are actually opened, of course, attendance is affected by the attendance restrictions and the time of the title. So, yeah, I think that any news that could help with seeing that light at the end of the tunnel, obviously, is great. I think most of all we do believe that studios are keep creating great movies and that there are audiences that are going to want to see [Indecipherable] they are going to see the best experiences. We just can't right now predict any better than anybody else when we're going to -- when that day is going to come.

Jim Goss -- Barrington Research -- Analyst

And we'll take our next question from Ivan Feinseth with Tigress Financial Partners.

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Ivan, are you on mute.

Ivan Feinseth -- Tigress Financial Partners -- Analyst

Sorry. Thank you for taking my call and congratulations on the great results in a difficult time. Did you start to work with Apple early on for the designing the iPhone 12 to incorporate Dolby Vision? And is there some things that are unique to the iPhone 12 that allow it to be in? Or will you be able to work with other phone manufacturers as well? And will we see this soon in some other brands?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Well, we have a long -- as you know, we have a long-standing relationship with Apple and they support Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos playback throughout their ecosystem. And so yeah, we've been working with them for some time to bring this experience to life. And our first focus is on making it a successful ecosystem. I mean, one thing, of course, that is true in Apple is that, they have all of the apps and the services and the devices and the entire ecosystem to bring an experience like this to life at scale. So job number one for us is to help them make that as successful as it could possibly be and to open up that ecosystem to other apps and services. And then from there, yes, so the time will certainly give an opportunity for this to be something that opens up new opportunities for us.

Ivan Feinseth -- Tigress Financial Partners -- Analyst

With other phone manufacturers as well?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Right.

Ivan Feinseth -- Tigress Financial Partners -- Analyst

Okay. Also in your decision to get out of conferencing, you mean just the conferencing hardware, you're still going to focus on implementing Dolby Voice into other conferencing products?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

That's right. We're still supporting our enterprise communications partners who are winding down the sale of the digital hardware for comp insurance.

Ivan Feinseth -- Tigress Financial Partners -- Analyst

And with the cash you have, when you think about acquisitions, is there any specific direction you envision like that you could extend your brand into?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Well, I think what we've been doing for the day has been in addition to expanding the presence of Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos across our existing categories. We see opportunities in new forms of content in gaming and music. But with Dolby.io, we are extending into all the ways in which we enjoy media and interactivity experiences. So when we think about acquisitions, it's through that lens. Are there opportunities that could accelerate or expand our opportunity? We don't look at it like we have this capital, so we need to go do an acquisition. And that's something that we're always -- we're obviously like any company, we're always looking at the opportunities that come our way.

Ivan Feinseth -- Tigress Financial Partners -- Analyst

Why You Should Be Buying This Tech Stock in November,Motley Fool,6 days ago,"The chipmaker reportedly gets a substantial chunk of its revenue from Apple, and its largest customer supplied 21% of the total revenue last quarter. Synaptics' ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/12/why-you-should-be-buying-this-tech-stock-november/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Synaptics (NASDAQ:SYNA) has beaten the broader stock market handsomely over the past year thanks to its shift to a higher-margin business model, and it looks like the shares have more upside to offer given the company's latest quarterly results.

The chipmaker's fiscal 2021 first-quarter earnings jumped significantly over the prior-year period on the back of strong momentum across the PC, mobile, and the Internet of Things (IoT) businesses. Synaptics exceeded its own expectations last quarter, and claims to have a nice pipeline of design wins and new product ramps that could help it move into a higher gear in this new fiscal year.

Let's see why Synaptics could remain a top tech stock and sustain its impressive rally.

Synaptics is making the right moves

Synaptics' fiscal first-quarter revenue came in at $328.4 million, down 3% over the prior-year period but higher than the midpoint of the company's guidance range of $315 million to $335 million. The lower revenue was because Synaptics' now-divested TDDI (touch and display driver integration) business was a part of the mobile segment in the year-ago quarter.

The liquid-crystal display (LCD) TDDI business generated $131 million in revenue in the first half of fiscal 2020 (about $65 million per quarter). So investors shouldn't be worried about the company's revenue decline, as it managed to substantially improve its margin profile thanks to the divestment.

Synaptics reported non-GAAP gross margin of 49.7% in the previous quarter, a huge jump over the prior-year period's figure of 41.5% and the highest level it has seen in over seven years. The company also clocked its highest operating margin in over six years. The margin gains translated into a nice earnings bump, with Synaptics reporting adjusted earnings of $1.85 per share, compared to $1.22 per share in the year-ago quarter.

The company is expected to enjoy strong earnings growth through the new fiscal year thanks to the divestment of the TDDI business and its focus on the higher-margin organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display driver segment. Rosenblatt Securities estimates that the sale of the TDDI business could boost Synaptics' earnings by $0.45 to $0.55 per share in fiscal 2021.

Major catalysts ahead

Synaptics' mobile business supplied 40% of its total revenue last quarter, and it is playing a key role in driving up its margins as the smartphone market shifts from LCDs to OLEDs. The company anticipates 10 new smartphones equipped with its OLED touch controllers to hit the market in the coming months, though it may have a huge winner on its hands in the form of the new Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 12 models.

Synaptics management pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that:

We also had our major handset OEM [original equipment manufacturer] announce their new flagship phones last month powered by our OLED touch controller.

The chipmaker reportedly gets a substantial chunk of its revenue from Apple, and its largest customer supplied 21% of the total revenue last quarter. Synaptics' mobile revenue shot up 25% year over year after adjusting for the sale of the TDDI business, and it is likely to sustain its momentum given reports that Apple is preparing to increase production and ship over 200 million units next year. The new iPhones could drive a mega upgrade cycle for Apple, and Synaptics could ride on the smartphone giant's coattails.

Looking beyond mobile, Synaptics is turning up the heat in the IoT business. The segment accounted for 35% of Synaptics' revenue last quarter, and it is expected to exceed the mobile business in size in the fiscal second quarter. The IoT business is benefiting from a broad range of growth trends in video interface solutions, audio chips, and smart homes.

With the IoT chip market expected to clock double-digit growth rates in the coming years, according to third-party estimates, it isn't surprising to see why Synaptics sees better days ahead in this business. So, investors who have been on the sidelines so far should take a closer look at Synaptics, as it has the ingredients to keep growing at a nice clip.

Finally, Synaptics trades at an attractive valuation. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24 is way lower than the five-year average multiple of 94. Meanwhile, a forward P/E ratio of 14.6 points toward future earnings growth, which Synaptics should be able to deliver given the catalysts it is sitting on.",draftkings,dkng,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.927, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.2023}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.927, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.2023}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.10115,0.0,0.10115,0.06743333333333333,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Positive,Neutral,Somewhat Positive
2 Cheap Dividend Stocks You Can Buy Right Now,Motley Fool,6 days ago,"Broadcom also generated a fifth of its revenues from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) last year, so it should benefit from robust sales of the iPhone 12 over the next few ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/12/2-cheap-dividend-stocks-you-can-buy-right-now/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","With the Nasdaq hovering near all-time highs, many tech stocks can't be considered cheap. Most high-growth tech companies also don't pay dividends, since they usually reinvest their cash into their expanding businesses.

But for investors who favor stability and income over high-risk growth, there are still plenty of tech stocks that pay high dividends and trade at low valuations. Let's take a closer look at two companies that fit that description: Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and IBM (NYSE:IBM).

1. Broadcom

Broadcom sells a wide range of chips for the data center, networking hardware, storage, broadband, wireless, and industrial markets. It also expanded into the infrastructure software market with its acquisitions of CA Technologies in 2018 and Symantec's security business in 2019.

Broadcom's stock rallied about 20% this year as the strength of its infrastructure software unit offset the pandemic-related disruptions of its semiconductor business. Its total revenue rose 4% year over year in the first nine months of 2020, but its adjusted EPS dipped 1% -- mainly due to the costs of integrating Symantec's security business.

Broadcom's sales of networking and broadband chips also stabilized sequentially in the second and third quarters, as cloud and telecom customers upgraded their infrastructure to address the surge in online activity throughout the pandemic. Analysts currently expect Broadcom's revenue and earnings to rise 6% and 3%, respectively, for the full year.

But looking into 2021, analysts expect Broadcom's revenue and earnings to rise 9% and 16%, respectively, as the pandemic passes and the expanding 5G and cloud markets lift sales of its networking and wireless chips. Broadcom also generated a fifth of its revenues from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) last year, so it should benefit from robust sales of the iPhone 12 over the next few quarters.

Broadcom has a well-diversified business, a wide moat, and its stock trades at just 15 times forward earnings. It currently pays a forward dividend yield of 3.4%, and it plans to spend about half of its free cash flow (FCF) on dividends every year. It spent 48% of its FCF on its dividend over the past 12 months -- which indicates its dividend remains rock-solid even as other companies cut or suspend their payouts.

2. IBM

IBM became a Dividend Aristocrat of the S&P 500 earlier this year after raising its dividend for the 25th straight year. Unfortunately, joining that elite group didn't prevent IBM's stock from dropping 14% this year as investors lost patience with its sluggish turnaround efforts.

But three significant things recently happened at IBM. First, IBM acquired the open source software provider Red Hat in July 2019. That acquisition expanded its hybrid cloud business, which allows companies to store their data on both public cloud platforms and on-site private clouds.

Second, Arvind Krishna, IBM's cloud and cognitive solutions chief, succeeded Ginni Rometty as its new CEO in April and immediately focused on expanding its higher-growth cloud businesses.

Lastly, Krishna recently revealed IBM would spin off its slow-growth IT services segment into a new company that prioritizes the growth of its hybrid cloud and AI businesses. That spin-off won't happen until late 2021, but it indicates IBM is finally streamlining its sprawling business and focusing on growing its revenue again.

For now, IBM's growth looks anemic. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to decline 4% and 34%, respectively, this year, as the ongoing pandemic throttles the growth of most of its non-cloud businesses.

But looking ahead into 2021, analysts expect IBM's revenue and earnings to rise 1% and 38%, respectively, as the pandemic passes. After IBM spins off its IT services segment, which constantly erases the growth of its cloud-based businesses, its growth should accelerate significantly in 2022 and beyond.

IBM's stock won't blast off anytime soon, but it trades at just 10 times forward earnings and pays a meaty forward dividend yield of 5.7%. It's unclear if the ""new"" IBM will remain a Dividend Aristocrat after its upcoming split, but the company has said that both new companies will pay a combined quarterly dividend that is ""no less"" than IBM's current dividend.",draftkings,dkng,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.173, 'compound': 0.6872}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.173, 'compound': 0.6872}]",0.6872,0.0,0.6872,0.45813333333333334,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive
3 5G Stocks That Also Pay Rock-Solid Dividends,Motley Fool,5 days ago,"Apple's recent launch of the iPhone 12, its first 5G smartphone, will inevitably boost Skyworks' sales. Wireless connections across a city. Image source: Getty ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/13/3-5g-stocks-which-also-pay-rock-solid-dividends/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Many wireless carriers have been expanding their fifth-generation (5G) networks, which can transfer data up to 100 times faster than 4G networks, over the past year. The growth of that market could pave the way for breakthroughs across the mobile, Internet of Things (IoT), automation, analytics, and artificial intelligence markets.

As a result, the global 5G services market could grow at a whopping compound annual growth rate of 43.9% between 2021 and 2027, according to Grand View Research. Investors who want a piece of that action have plenty of stocks to choose from, but only a handful of those companies pay dividends.

Let's take a closer look at three companies that will profit from the growth of the 5G market while paying decent dividends to patient investors: Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).

What does the 5G market means to these three companies?

Before we discuss these companies' dividends, we should see how the 5G market's secular growth will boost their revenues and earnings.

Ericsson controlled 14% of the world's telecom equipment market last year, according to Dell'Oro Group, putting it in third place behind Huawei's 27% share and Nokia's (NYSE:NOK) 16% share. Ericsson is arguably the strongest of the top three players.

Huawei faces blacklists and sanctions. Nokia is dealing with sluggish network upgrades, tough competition in China, and a recent CEO change. Ericsson isn't struggling with any management issues, it's growing faster than Nokia in China, and it's already signed 116 commercial 5G agreements or contracts with unique operators worldwide.

Skyworks produces wireless chips for the mobile, automotive, home automation, wireless infrastructure, and industrial markets. Its top customer is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which accounted for 51% of its revenue last year. Apple's recent launch of the iPhone 12, its first 5G smartphone, will inevitably boost Skyworks' sales.

But that's not all: Skyworks expects industry-wide front-end chip revenue to hit $25 per 5G smartphone, up from $18 per 4G device and $8 per 3G device. Those content share gains, along with Skyworks' expansion into non-smartphone markets, make it a top 5G play.

Qualcomm is the world's top manufacturer of wireless modems, which it integrates into its industry-leading Snapdragon system on chips (SoCs) for mobile devices. It also owns the world's largest portfolio of wireless patents, which entitles it to a cut of every smartphone sold worldwide.

Those two core businesses make Qualcomm the unofficial gatekeeper of the 5G market. Most of the world's 5G smartphones will be powered by Qualcomm's SoCs, and every original equipment manufacturer (OEM) -- even those that don't use Qualcomm's chips -- will need to pay it 5G licensing fees.

How healthy are their dividends?

When investors research a company's dividend, they should focus on three things: the company's cash dividend payout ratio, or the percentage of its free cash flow paid out as dividends over the past 12 months; its forward dividend yield; and its track of record of annual dividend hikes.

Company Cash Dividend

Payout Ratio Forward

Dividend Yield Consecutive Years

of Dividend Hikes Ericsson 26.4% 1.4% 1 Skyworks 38.1% 1.4% 6 Qualcomm 65.4% 1.8% 1

Ericsson pays semi-annual dividends, which are set every year based on its profits instead of regular year-over-year increases. Skyworks and Qualcomm both pay quarterly dividends.

Qualcomm finally raised its dividend earlier this year after a two-year freeze. During that time, it prioritized big buybacks over dividends after it abandoned its takeover of NXP and narrowly fended off a hostile takeover attempt by Broadcom.

Skyworks has consistently raised its dividend every year since its introduction in 2014. All three companies have plenty of room to raise their dividends in the future, and none of them suspended their payouts during the COVID-19 crisis.

Are these stocks cheap relative to their growth?

Investors should take analysts' forecasts with a grain of salt, but all three companies are expected to generate solid revenue and earnings growth next year as the 5G market expands. All three stocks are also reasonably valued relative to those near-term forecasts, but Ericsson looks the cheapest:

Company Revenue Growth,

Next Fiscal Year EPS Growth,

Next Fiscal Year Forward

P/E Ratio Ericsson 7% 24% 16 Skyworks 9% 14% 19 Qualcomm 7% 11% 22

The key takeaway

Ericsson, Skyworks, and Qualcomm probably won't impress serious income investors, but their dividends present a nice bonus for investors who are willing to patiently wait for the 5G market's tailwinds to kick in.",draftkings,dkng,"[{'neg': 0.167, 'neu': 0.833, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.1027}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.847, 'pos': 0.153, 'compound': 0.4019}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.847, 'pos': 0.153, 'compound': 0.4019}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.13396666666666665,-0.1027,0.13396666666666665,0.05507777777777776,Neutral,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Negative,Somewhat Positive
"What Is a Pure-Play REIT, and Is One Right for You?",Motley Fool,6 days ago,"On the other hand, Apple Hospitality REIT (NYSE: APLE) is a pure play on midlevel hotel real estate. And National Retail Properties (NYSE: NNN) is a pure play ...",https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-investing/articles/what-is-a-pure-play-reit-and-is-one-right-for-you/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Real estate investment trusts (REITs) generally specialize in a certain type of commercial property, but that doesn't mean they only invest in their core property type. For example, many office REITs also have some retail space in their portfolio. Some indoor mall REITs also have some shopping center assets.

Companies that invest exclusively in a certain type of asset are referred to as pure plays. For example, a pure-play shopping center REIT would only own shopping centers and no other kinds of assets.

Pure-play vs. 'focused' REIT examples

As mentioned, many REITs focus on a specific property type. For example, Ryman Hospitality Properties (NYSE: RHP) primarily owns group-focused hotels, Realty Income's (NYSE: O) focus is on freestanding retail properties, and Empire State Realty Trust (NYSE: ESRT) largely owns urban office space.

But none of these are pure plays. In addition to its hotels, Ryman gets a small portion of its revenue from entertainment venues like the Grand Ole Opry. About 15% of Realty Income's portfolio is made up of office, industrial, and agricultural properties. And like many urban office REITs, Empire State Realty Trust has significant exposure to retail real estate, plus it owns and operates the observatory on top of the Empire State Building.

On the other hand, Apple Hospitality REIT (NYSE: APLE) is a pure play on midlevel hotel real estate. And National Retail Properties (NYSE: NNN) is a pure play on single-tenant retail.

Advantages and disadvantages to pure-play REITs

The main reason to consider a pure-play REIT over one with multiple property types is for a narrow focus. If a company is very good at evaluating, operating, developing, and managing a certain type of property, it can be a net benefit to investors for management to stick to their core competence rather than trying to branch out and create multiple income streams. For example, if National Retail Properties were to announce it was going to start buying medical office buildings, it would negatively affect my opinion of it, since the REIT has such an excellent track record in its core property type.

On the other hand, the downside to a pure-play REIT is the same thing as its key advantage: a laser focus on a single type of commercial real estate. This can be a disadvantage in tough times. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Realty Income's industrial and office properties helped offset the effects of retail closures.

The Millionacres bottom line

There's no perfect answer to the ""pure-play or diversified"" debate, and it depends on the REIT. In my own portfolio, I own some pure plays and some with two or more property types in their portfolio. The bottom line is that a pure play REIT can be an excellent way to invest if the management team is very good at generating superior returns from a single type of property and you're prepared to ride out any cyclicality that comes with such a narrow investment focus. But it's important to evaluate REITs on a case-by-case basis -- a solid, well-run operation is far more important as a long-term investor than a narrow or diversified business focus.",draftkings,dkng,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.741, 'pos': 0.259, 'compound': 0.6808}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.806, 'pos': 0.194, 'compound': 0.34}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.741, 'pos': 0.259, 'compound': 0.6808}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.806, 'pos': 0.194, 'compound': 0.34}]",0.5104,0.0,0.5104,0.34026666666666666,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive

I would now like to turn the conference call over to Jason Dea, Director of Investor Relations for Dolby Laboratories. Please go ahead, Jason.

Jason Dea -- Director of Investor Relations

Good afternoon. Welcome to Dolby Laboratories' fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Kevin Yeaman, Dolby Laboratories President and CEO; and Lewis Chew, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including our first quarter and second quarter fiscal 2021 outlook and our assumptions underlying that outlook. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made today.

In particular, we expect that the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business remains uncertain at this time. A discussion of these and additional risks and uncertainties can be found in the earnings press release that we issued today, under the section captioned forward-looking statements, as well as in the Risk Factors section of our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Dolby assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any forward-looking statements made during this call as a result of new information or future events.

During today's call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is available in our earnings press release and in the Dolby Laboratories Investor Relations data sheet on the Investor Relations section of our website.

As for the content of today's call, Lewis will begin with a recap of Dolby's financial results and provide our first and second quarter 2021 outlook, and Kevin will finish with a discussion of the business.

So with that introduction behind us, I will now turn the call to Lewis.

Lewis Chew -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

All right. Thank you, Jason, and congratulations in advance for the impending arrival of your second child. So good afternoon, everyone. I hope everyone is doing well. Our Q4 revenue was above our guidance, but we are still down on a year-over-year basis and that reflects the ongoing impact of the pandemic. So let's go through the numbers.

Fourth quarter revenue was $271 million, compared to $247 million in Q3 and $299 million in Q4 of last year. Our revenue guidance coming into the fourth quarter was a range of $225 million to $255 million. So compared to guidance, revenues were better than what we projected as we had a true-up of about $25 million in the quarter related to Q3 shipments, which was about $15 million higher than the true-up that we had last quarter, and with most of that improvement coming from TVs and set-top boxes, and PCs.

Total company revenue in Q4 increased sequentially by $24 million compared to Q3, as we benefited from higher unit volumes in TVs, set-top boxes, DMAs and PCs, along with the higher true-up that I just discussed. And all of this was partially offset by lower revenue from mobile due to timing under contracts, and I will discuss that in a second.

Now looking at Q4 on a year-over-year basis, total company revenue is down by $28 million from last year's Q4 and we can attribute that mainly to COVID-19, especially in products and services, which were down by about $20 million or nearly 60% below last year. The composition of Q4 revenue was $257 million in licensing and $14 million in products and services. So let's break down licensing revenue by end market, starting with broadcast.

Broadcast represented about 47% of total licensing in the fourth quarter. Broadcast revenues increased by about 2% year-over-year, helped by the higher true-up related to the Q3 shipments and also driven by higher adoption in TVs and set-top boxes. And then this was then offset partially by lower recoveries in the quarter. On a sequential basis, broadcast was up by about 35% due to higher volume in TVs and set-top boxes along with higher recoveries and the higher true-up.

Mobile. Mobile represented approximately 15% of total licensing in Q4. Mobile was down by about 13% over last year due to lower recoveries, but partially offset by higher adoption of Dolby Technologies. For the sequential comparison, I should point out that last quarter Q3, Mobile was about 33% licensing, which was higher than normal, and that was due to timing of revenue under customer contracts, so we came into Q4 expecting Mobile revenue to decline this quarter and return to a more normalized percentage of revenue, which is what it did. So accordingly Mobile revenue was down sequentially by about 50%, and that was primarily due to timing of revenue under customer contracts.

Consumer electronics represented about 13% of total licensing in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, CE licensing was down by about 8%, mainly due to lower recoveries. On a sequential basis, CE was about 68% higher than Q3. And as a reminder, Q3 was lower than usual and only 9% of licensing because of timing under contract. And so, the sequential increase from Q3 to Q4 was mostly a return to a more normal level.

PC represented about 12% of total licensing in Q4. PC was higher than last year by about 26%, helped by the higher true-up and also because of the increased adoption of Dolby Technologies. And sequentially, PC was up by about 32% that's for similar reasons.

Other markets represented about 13% of total licensing in the fourth quarter and they were down by about 19% year-over-year due to significantly lower Dolby Cinema box office share and that's because of the COVID restrictions and lack of big titles, and also because of lower revenues from gaming due to console life cycles and/or recoveries in automotive. On a sequential basis, other markets was up by about 32%, driven by higher revenue from gaming and from via admin fees and that's the patent pool that we administered.

Beyond licensing, our products and services revenue was $14.3 million in Q4, compared to $11.8 million in Q3 and $34 million in last year's Q4. Our guidance had anticipated the large year-over-year decrease because most of this revenue comes from equipment that we sell to cinema exhibitors and these customers continue to be negatively affected by the pandemic.

And speaking of products and services revenue, going forward into Q1, we're winding down and exiting conferencing hardware sales, as we will now be fully focused on expanding the availability of the Dolby Voice experience through software solutions, such as interactivity APIs on our developer platform. So later on, when I cover the outlook for FY '21, my comments on products and services revenue and gross margin will reflect the fact that we are exiting the conferencing hardware arena.

Now I'd like to discuss Q4 margins and operating expenses. Total gross margin in the fourth quarter was 84.3% on a GAAP basis and 85.1% on a non-GAAP basis. Products and services gross margin on a GAAP basis was minus $15.5 million in the fourth quarter and a large portion of that consisted of charges for excess and obsolete inventory associated with conferencing hardware and that relates back to what I just said a minute ago, about our plans in that space.

Going forward into Q1, we anticipate that products and services margin will still be negative, but more along the lines of around minus $3 million or minus $4 million. I'll cover this again in the outlook section in a few minutes. Products and services gross margin on a non-GAAP basis was minus $14.1 million in the fourth quarter, and my comments here are similar to what I just said for GAAP gross margins.

Operating expenses in the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis were slightly above the high-end of the range that we had guided, coming in at a $198.7 million, compared to $182.9 million in Q3. And remember that Q3 was particularly low for us, because that was the first full quarter of reacting to COVID-19 and lots of our activities have been temporarily halted or pushed out. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter on a non-GAAP basis were $176.5 million, which is within our range and that was compared to $159.2 million in the third quarter, and basically the same comments that I made in GAAP apply here as well.

Operating income in the fourth quarter was $30.1 million on a GAAP basis or 11.1% of revenue, compared to $51.2 million or 17.1% of revenue in Q4 of last year. Operating income in the fourth quarter on a non-GAAP basis was $54.3 million or 20% of revenue, compared to $77.6 million or 26% of revenue in Q4 of last year.

Income tax in Q4 was 21.8% on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The effective tax rate was slightly higher than guidance, and that was due mainly to the mix of our income between different tax jurisdictions.

Net income on a GAAP basis in the fourth quarter was $26.8 million or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to $43.9 million or $0.43 per diluted share in last year's Q4. Net income on a non-GAAP basis in the fourth quarter was $45.8 million or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $67.6 million or $0.66 per diluted share in Q4 of last year.

For both GAAP and non-GAAP, net income in Q4 was above the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the quarter, and that was primarily due to revenue being above the high-end of our range, offset partially by the lower product and services gross margin that I mentioned a minute ago.

During the fourth quarter, we generated about $113 million in cash from operations, which compares to about $130 million generated in last year's fourth quarter. We ended the fourth quarter with nearly $1.2 billion in cash and investments.

During Q4, we bought back about 640,000 shares of our common stock and ended the quarter with about $187 million of stock repurchase authorization still available to us. We also announced today a cash dividend of $0.22 per share. The dividend will be payable on December 4, 2020 to shareholders of record on November 24, 2020.

Before I go into the outlook for FY '21, let's summarize the results for the full-year FY '20. Total revenue in FY '20 was $1,162 million that compares to $1,241 million in the prior year with a year-over-year decline due to the impact from COVID-19. Within total revenue, licensing was $1,079 million, which was down about $28 million from last year due to lower consumer activity because of the pandemic, while products and services revenue was $83 million for the year, down about $51 million from last year due mainly to lower demand from the cinema industry because of restrictions brought on also by the pandemic.

Operating income for the full-year FY '20 was $219 million on a GAAP basis or about 19% of revenue and operating income on a non-GAAP basis was $318 million or about 27% of revenue. Net income on a GAAP basis was $231 million or $2.25 per diluted share and net income on a non-GAAP basis was $305 million or $2.97 per diluted share. And cash flow from operations for the full-year was $344 million and that's slightly up from the previous year, where cash flow from operations was $328 million.

So now let's discuss the full-year outlook. First, let me say that we'll be facing some interesting dynamics in FY '21 with our year-over-year comparisons. Because we have a September year-end, the first two quarters of FY '20 were mostly unaffected by COVID-19, while the last two quarters of FY '20 were fully affected by COVID. And as we head into FY '21, COVID continues to persist and visibility is very limited, even more so the further out you tried to look.

So today, I'm going to provide an outlook scenario for the first half of the year, including our perspective on what Q1 and Q2 revenue could be and for the second half of the year because visibility is limited, we are not providing guidance at this time, but I will provide some color on some of the factors that could affect the second half.

So let's discuss the first half. In the first half of FY '21, we currently anticipate year-over-year growth in licensing revenue, and that could be offset by year-over-year decline in products and services revenue. The anticipated growth that we could get in licensing would come mainly from higher adoption of our technologies as industry analysts currently are projecting market TAM to be flat to slightly down in the first half.

And also, we anticipate Dolby Cinema licensing revenue to be significantly down year-over-year in our first half because of that COVID versus pre-COVID factor of comparison in the cinema industry. And then for that same reason, we are anticipating cinema product sales to be down year-over-year.

Now within the first half of the year, based on what we currently see, here is the scenario we are assuming for Q1 and then Q2. In the first quarter of FY '21, we anticipate that total revenue could range from $330 million to $360 million. Within that, we estimate that licensing could range from $320 million to $345 million, while products and services is projected to range from $10 million to $15 million. At the midpoint of the range, we anticipate growth in lights seem to be driven by a higher adoption of our technologies across a range of devices.

In addition, the Q1 licensing outlook is benefiting from timing of revenue under customer contracts, as well as potentially higher recoveries. Now we are not anticipating as much revenue from these items, namely the timing of the recoveries in our second quarter. And by the way, last year, it was Q2 not Q1 that benefited more from timing of recoveries.

So with that in mind, and based on what we currently see and having just gone over the Q1 revenue outlook, we currently see our Q2 revenue scenario looking like a range of about $270 million to $300 million. And doing the math for you on the first half of FY '21 by combining the Q1 and Q2 figures that I just went over, our current outlook scenario assumes a first half FY '21 revenue range of $600 million to $660 million. We will plan to update you on how this picture has evolved after Q1 is completed.

As for the second half, like I said, we are not giving guidance for the second half, but here are some points to consider. On a sequential basis in our licensing revenue, we typically see second half revenue is lower than the first half because of lower seasonality in consumer device shipments and also because of the timing of revenue on the customer contract.

On a year-over-year basis, while we do expect to see continuing benefit from increased adoption of Dolby Technologies, it's worth noting that with respect to market TAM, current industry analysts reports are projecting markets like PC and TV TAM to be down on a year-over-year basis in the second half. And that's because of an uptick in unit shipments that happened in the latter part of FY '20 that might not repeat in that same timeframe next year. So, of course, it's much too early to know if that will be true, but that's what the current reports currently suggest.

And as for Dolby Cinema and cinema products, the year-over-year comparison should be favorable in the second half, but we don't know to what extent or at what pace. So those are a few things to think about for the second half and we thought it was worth providing you that color.

So let me now finish up by providing the outlook on the rest of the P&L for Q1, already highlighted the revenue range scenario of $330 million to $360 million. So Q1 gross margin on a GAAP basis is estimated to range from 90% to 91%, and the non-GAAP gross margin is estimated to range from 91% to 92%. Within that, products and services gross margin is estimated to range from minus $3 million to minus $4 million on a GAAP basis, and from minus $2 billion to minus $3 million on a non-GAAP basis.

As I mentioned earlier, we are winding down and exiting the conferencing hardware space, and the demand for cinema products continues to be weak because of the industry conditions. And as a result, we are reducing certain resources in manufacturing, as well as other areas that were connected with conferencing hardware and cinema products. We anticipate that it will take several months to complete, various activities to smoothly transition our conferencing hardware partners and then customers.

With respect to the impact on our products and services gross margin, we estimate that we could start to see savings in our cost of goods sold by around the end of fiscal Q2, and that's because of these transitioning activities that we have to undertake.

Operating expenses in Q1 on a GAAP basis are estimated to range from $207 million to $219 million. Included in this range is approximately $7 million to $9 million of restructuring charges for severances and related benefits that are being provided to employees that are impacted by the actions that I just mentioned a minute ago. Operating expenses in Q1 on a non-GAAP basis are estimated to range from $175 million to $185 million, and this range excludes the estimated restructuring charge.

Other income is projected to range from $1 million to $2 million for the quarter, and our effective tax rate for Q1 is projected to range from 20% to 21% on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis. So based on a combination of the factors I just covered, we estimate that Q1 diluted earnings per share could range from $0.70 to $0.85 on a GAAP basis and from $0.97 to $1.12 on a non-GAAP basis.

So that's it for me. Over to you, Kevin.

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Thank you, Lewis. And thank you everybody for joining us today. I want to focus my comments on three main areas today. I will start by highlighting our continued progress, increasing the number of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experiences around the world. I'll then spend a few minutes on the changes we have made in our cinema and conferencing hardware business to adjust to the evolving conditions in certain markets. And then I will share some thoughts on the exciting opportunity for Dolby to address a new world of content through our developer platform and related initiatives.

Before we move on, I do want to take a moment to thank our employees for their dedication and creativity. In a year where we all face challenges and disruptions, we have continued to bring more Dolby experiences to more people around the world, and they are the driving force behind the Dolby magic.

So let me start with the Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos ecosystem that continues to grow. With the launch of the iPhone 12, consumers are now able to see the benefits of Dolby Vision when they record video and share it. We are excited about the opportunity to support this ecosystem so the Dolby Vision content can be enjoyed on social media, video sharing sites and more. This will vastly expand the content that can be enjoyed in Dolby Vision, adding more reasons for devices and services to adopt our technology and creating new opportunities for Dolby.

During 2020, we continued to grow the presence of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos across the many ways that people enjoy movie and TV content. At the beginning of the year we saw the launches of Disney+ and Apple TV+ with the combined Dolby experience. Google Play, Showtime and PBS all began streaming in Dolby Vision this year. In this quarter, Watcher a streaming service in Korea began supporting content in Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos.

The momentum of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos within movie and TV content continues to drive an expanding lineup of devices within the home. The adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos within 4K TV shipments grew significantly year-over-year. Our partners like TCL, Sony, Panasonic and Skyworth added support for the Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experience deeper within their TV lineups and have also broadened the global reach of their offerings, including this year into India.

Xiaomi launched their first TV that supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos just this year. And we continue to bring new innovations to market, like Dolby Vision IQ, which optimizes the picture on your TV by adjusting to the surrounding line and to the type of content being viewed. Our continued innovation brings new value to our partners and consumers and adds to the reasons for deeper adoption.

Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos continue to grow across a broader range of devices. Apple recently began enabling support for Dolby Atmos to the HomePod. Earlier this year, Sonos launched its first Dolby Atmos product with the Sonos Arc and Roku began supporting Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos with the Roku Ultra. We are also beginning to see increasing adoption of the combined experience within set-top boxes, including the latest offerings from Free in France and Deutsche Telekom in Germany.

Within Mobile and PC, Apple highlights the adoption of the Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos playback with support throughout their iPad, MacBook and iPhone lineups. We also have strong initial adoption of Dolby Atmos within the latest flagship mobile phones from Samsung, OPPO and Sony. Lenovo launched several new PCs that support the combined experience and Dell began shipping Dolby Vision enabled PCs earlier this year.

We see significant growth opportunities within both Mobile and PC as we gain new wins, drive deeper adoption within our partners' device lineups and expand the types of content that can be enjoyed with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. In the same way, the Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos enabled great movie and TV content, we see a significant opportunity to create immersive experiences within music and gaming. These are important forms of entertainment that expand our current value proposition and grow the number of devices that can benefit from the Dolby experience.

Let me start with music. A year ago, we launched Dolby Atmos for music with Amazon Music HD and the Amazon Echo Studio. The music in Dolby experience has been met with deep and passionate engagement from artists. For example, those that we highlighted in the stories from Lizzo, Post Malone, Coldplay and J Balvin. Tidal became the second streaming service to support Dolby Atmos Music, enabling millions of Dolby Atmos devices within mobile and in the home. Our increasing presence in music will create opportunities to grow adoption in mobile, automotive, smart speakers and headphones.

In gaming, Microsoft announced their new Xbox to be the first gaming console to support the combined Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experience for gaming. We are also seeing a growing number of gaming PCs adopt the Dolby experience, including new products from Lenovo and ASUS this year. As we grow the presence of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos within gaming content, we add to the value proposition for broader adoption within PCs, gaming consoles and mobile phones.

Our momentum for Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos across content, services and devices is strong and at the same time, we still see much of the opportunity ahead of us. We continue to grow our presence throughout devices within the home, and we made it even earlier stages of adoption within mobile and PC. We are focused on accelerating that adoption by increasing the amount of content and by broadening our presence in categories like music and gaming.

Let me shift now to talk about the areas where we have made some changes to adjust to the evolving conditions in certain markets. The cinema environment remains challenging as the time of recovery is uncertain and the landscape is evolving. As Lewis discussed, we have made some adjustments to operations and manufacturing here to reflect a lower outlook for demand. At the same time, we remain confident that studios will continue to create great content that audiences will continue to want to experience these movies in the cinema and that they will take out the best experiences.

Let me spend a few -- just a few moments on Dolby Voice. We entered the communication space with the goal of enabling higher quality and more natural meeting experiences. Our value proposition of enabling higher quality interactions remains as strong and relevant as ever and we see significant opportunities to broaden the reach of our technologies. As we move forward, we are winding down the sales of our conferencing hardware to focus all of our efforts on the larger opportunity to enable the Dolby Voice experience through our enterprise partners and our developer platform.

And that brings me to the opportunity to bring the Dolby experience to the vast and growing amount of content that are a part of our everyday lives, from user-generated content to social media and casual entertainment to everyday virtual interactions.

Today, developers can access our technology through Dolby.io to improve media and interactivity within their applications. We have seen growing engagement from developers across a variety of industries and use cases from improving audio quality in podcast, media production and online marketplace videos to enabling interactivity in online education, social media, and live streaming applications. This quarter, we began partnering with SoundCloud to enable artists to improve the quality of their tracks using our mastering APIs and have seen nearly 200,000 tracks mastered through our APIs in the few months since launch.

We are also working to integrate our media APIs onto the box platform this quarter to enable their customers to enhance content with our media APIs right within the box experience. Additionally, we recently enabled our interactivity APIs to include the benefits of Dolby Voice and we have drawn strong engagement from developers since its release.

As we look ahead, we will continue to expand our offerings to address more audio and video features. For example, now that consumers can create Dolby Vision with the iPhone 12. We see opportunities to support content platforms seeking to make the most of this expanding world of Dolby Vision content. While we are just at the beginning of these new opportunities, we are learning quickly from our early engagement with developers and evolving our offering to bring the Dolby experience to everyday applications and services.

So to wrap up, the momentum of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos with movies and TV content is strong as our partners continue to bring new devices and services to market. Our opportunity remains ahead of us and we are enabling more content experiences in music and gaming that can accelerate the adoption across device categories.

Consumers can now capture and edit in Dolby Vision for the first time, expanding the Dolby experiences into the growing world of user-generated content. And we are excited by the opportunity to bring the Dolby experience to new use cases and industries through our developer platform. All of this gives us confidence in our ability to drive revenue and earnings growth into the future. I look forward to updating you next quarter.

And with that, I will turn it over to Q&A.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steven Frankel with Colliers.

Steven Frankel -- Colliers -- Analyst

Good afternoon, and thanks for the opportunity. Kevin, I want you to talk a little bit about the Dolby.io opportunity. Maybe tell us a little bit about the go-to-market approach. And specifically around voice, how do you take voice, which has so much promise embedded into some higher volume applications, where it can really make a difference to the consumer?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Thanks, Steve. Yeah, we're really excited about the opportunity to improve so many different types of experiences, including the Dolby Voice. And in terms of how we're bringing it to market, we are first focused on our engagement with developers. We've brought a lot of people on board who have a lot of experience doing that, knowing them with the teams that we have that understand how to apply our technology and expertise to improve media and interaction experiences.

So it really is about reaching out to developers, growing that community, bringing them to our platform, make it easy for them to understand how they can employ these technologies, and then also learning from them to then evolve our offerings and bring to bear more of our expertise and more of our IT portfolio to solve new challenges. And of course, over the last six months our product teams have had the opportunity to engage with a lot of potential developers and customers who's really deploying these technologies.

As it relates to Dolby Voice, it's about the interactivity that we experience on our apps and services every day and so that runs across telehealth, online education. We see opportunities in that where entertainment needs communications to work in areas like in the future. We're talking to people about areas like social media or live streaming platforms where people want to introduce interactivity. These are all areas that we see opportunities to bring Dolby Voice to life through the developer platform.

Steven Frankel -- Colliers -- Analyst

And your existing partners like BlueJeans, should we expect them to adopt the software approach as well, so even without your hardware they can get that same experience?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

They do that today, Steve. So BlueJeans has the Dolby Voice service integrated into their full platform. So you do not require the Dolby hardware to get that experience, and we continue to work with BlueJeans and consumers -- BlueJeans customers will continue to enjoy the Dolby Voice experience when they're participating over their mobile devices and their PCs like so many [Indecipherable] are doing for so many hours a day.

Steven Frankel -- Colliers -- Analyst

Great. And you didn't mention anything about gaming given the two new platforms just hitting the market, both of which are sold out. Have you seen that in the numbers in the September quarter or is that coming in the December quarter?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Coming, we're about to go through a refresh cycle. I did touch on it briefly, Steve, but I'm sure you're aware, Xbox is supporting Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos for gaming and we're really excited about that. And so, yeah, of course, the refresh cycle is something that is likely to benefit us in the coming -- these couple of quarters. And gaming is a big area of focus for us across the globe. Certainly, we're focused on making that Xbox experience so successful and a bit of an ecosystem of content as possible. But beyond that, we believe that we can add value in mobile gaming and other areas.

Steven Frankel -- Colliers -- Analyst

And then just one last one. Where do you think your market share is today in Dolby Vision in 4K TVs given that what you're talking about the phenomenon and new geographies and more modest?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yeah. So first of all, Steve, I will say the data is still coming in on that, because, of course, we will get our Q4 reports in the coming weeks and the industry analysts are not quite -- maybe it's not possible there for adapting to this uncertain environment. So the numbers are still coming in, but we're confident that we are going to end up somewhere between 15% and 20% Dolby Vision to 4K TVs and that 4K TVs are probably coming in this last fiscal year for us at somewhere just over 50% of the market.

Steven Frankel -- Colliers -- Analyst

All right. Thank you, Kevin.

Okay. The next question is from -- We'll take our next question from Ralph Schackart with William Blair.

Ralph Schackart -- William Blair -- Analyst

Good evening. First question on the true-up that you called out in the quarter, less than 25 months, a little bit larger than the normal. If you could talk about maybe 15 higher than expected. Any more color on that as 606 are affecting the true-up this quarter?

Lewis Chew -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Sure. And we've been very transparent about this even before we launched 606 that we're going to have this. First of all, I'll reassure you that our processes is very solid, applied very consistently. And the biggest piece of that bump in true-up was new data that we got in on some of the key TAMs in the markets we work on were higher than what had been published at the TAM at the time we did the estimate, and that was across several different categories. So of course, we flow that right through and that affects the number of units that our customers report, because I think I've talked about this in the past that our technique uses interpolation, where we use multiple data points, customer inputs, market share data points and also TAM data. And so the biggest thing driving that uptick in the true-up was an uptick in the TAM there versus what we had [Indecipherable]

Ralph Schackart -- William Blair -- Analyst

Okay. And then we get a lot of questions on the opportunity [Indecipherable] there's obviously a lot of excitement around it, it sounds like you're making great progress in the quarter. Anyway just sort of give us a sense on how to frame this opportunity and put some numbers around it in a range of that's very wide. And if not, just sort of like maybe the building blocks, how to think of potential size on it?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yeah. Obviously, Ralph, let me back up. We do think this is a big opportunity. And for a very long time I might have said that we believe we can improve any audio visual experience and this is what gives us the opportunity to expand that Dolby experience far beyond our traditional realms. We're about six months in, and so right now what we're focused on is engagement with developers. As I think [Indecipherable] we have a number of -- growing number of initial customers that are out there using the platform. And we definitely look forward to providing more data as we go forward here. But we're excited about the customers that we're engaged with and that are coming on right now.

Ralph Schackart -- William Blair -- Analyst

Great. One more, Kevin. Just if you can kind of take a step back and envision at post-COVID world, but hopefully we get too sooner rather than later. Maybe just some updated thoughts on your kind of long-term goal to march back to double-digit growth. We are sort of confident around that prior statement that you're talked about before?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yeah. Well, I feel I'm really pleased with our portfolio of growth opportunities. And I think on the Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos portfolios, we talked about -- we probably have the strongest progress in the living room for movies and TV. I mean, as we just talked about that puts us at about 15% to 20% attached to 4K TVs. We are in even earlier stage with PCs and mobile devices. And we do believe that this focus on additional forms of content, gaming, music are the key to really opening up those opportunities for us. And I think that with Apple embracing the ability to capture, share, edit, content in Dolby Vision, I think that just is the best testament to how the Dolby experience can apply far beyond even those more traditional forms of content. So that's a big growth area.

And then as we talked about -- we're just talking about Dolby.io. So we're really excited about the ability to serve those new markets and new industries, unlocking the creativity of developers with the decades of experience and technology we have in making for the best high quality media and interactions. And so, we do see that as another significant growth opportunity.

Ralph Schackart -- William Blair -- Analyst

Great. Thanks, Kevin. Thanks, Lewis.

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yeah.

Our next question comes from Paul Chung with JP Morgan.

Paul Chung -- JP Morgan -- Analyst

Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So just on your guidance, as you -- timing of contracts with one of your largest customers just shifting into F-1Q from F-2Q, so are we going to see better relative performance in PCs and Mobile in 1Q?

Lewis Chew -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Well, I stopped sort of giving a breakdown by market because those tend to move around, but yes, this year we do see more of that timing of contracts issue affecting us in Q1 versus last year's in Q2, but for the first half as a whole, it tends to be relatively similar. I should remind you too that, as we roll on as each year goes along, we do get additional customers and get more penetration. So it's not necessarily the same items every year. It's just something we have to live with now under 606. But yes, to your question, Paul, clearly this year we see a little bit more of that benefit from the timing of contract issue falling into Q1 versus Q2 than it did last year, where it fell more into Q2 versus Q1.

Paul Chung -- JP Morgan -- Analyst

Okay. And then secondly, can you talk about the Dolby Vision recording capability on the iPhone? You got a lot of good air time during the event, which is great exposure there. So is there incremental revenue associated with this feature? And are you getting interest from other prominent OEMs kind of looking at this?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yeah. So again, we couldn't be more thrilled to have Apple embrace Dolby Vision for capture and sharing of content. And, obviously, we're not going to get into the specific economics of our relationship with Apple, but I think it does a couple of things for us. One, it again is an amazing example of how Dolby can apply far beyond movies, TV, and even gaming and music.

Secondly, yes, we do think it opens up over time the opportunity to bring that experience to a broader audience. And then third, we think in a world of a large and growing ecosystem of Dolby Vision content in these new areas that there could be some interesting opportunities in some of our newer initiatives to help people get the most out of that content.

Paul Chung -- JP Morgan -- Analyst

Great. Thanks guys. Great job.

Lewis Chew -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

All right, Paul. Thanks.

We'll take our next question from Eric Wold with B. Riley Securities.

Eric Wold -- B. Riley Securities -- Analyst

Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. A couple of questions. A follow-up on kind of always the conversation around Dolby.io. I know it's early, six months in, you are not going to talking about guidance. Is there a way to maybe frame kind of what the average deal size or user size could look like? Or you're trying to think about what the best way to think about the revenue ramp as you gain penetration? Or is it going to be just so many smaller user's revenue flow just that's not the right way to think about it?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Well, as you've said, it's early, but I think we can already see that there will be a pretty broad distribution, right? There will be customers that are certainly in historical Dolby standards are -- might be [Indecipherable] customer. But I think there's also some opportunities to have some reasonably large customers. I think it's all going be about their scale and their use case. So right now where we're seeing early adoption are in areas like improving recorded audio in a number of use cases like SoundCloud, podcasts, [Indecipherable] online platform for the automobile industry for those looking to digitize. So people do videos of the car they are selling and we clean up that audio for them.

So for those customers, the value proposition is a better quality experience. In some cases, saving them time and money on what they were doing to clean it up. And so, the revenue potential is very much a function of the global services and the same is true on the interactivity side. And many of our customers are just kind of -- they're getting hands up and have the potential to grow quite a lot more from where they're today.

Eric Wold -- B. Riley Securities -- Analyst

Okay. And then, last question, obviously, this question you get all the time with a $1.2 billion in cash and no debt and seemingly very strong free cash flow trends do continue. At what point [Indecipherable] there's a need to put that to you to bring home your pocket, but what's the -- that kind of need [Indecipherable] in some manners, obviously you are buying back stock, but there's clearly a limit there to agree. Do acquisitions come more into play, or it's just nothing really inside that can really make a dent in that?

Lewis Chew -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Well, first of all, we regularly review our capital allocation and as you point out, we have also returned cash buybacks and a recurring dividend. I would say that we're always looking for potential acquisitions that could accelerate our business, historically that's tended to be that you might think of as technology tuck-ins. And I think as we go into new areas, that will also open up new opportunities for us to consider. But we'll make those decisions based on where we see opportunities to accelerate and expand the opportunities that we're in pursuit of.

Eric Wold -- B. Riley Securities -- Analyst

Got it. Thank you, guys.

Lewis Chew -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Okay. Eric, thanks.

Our next question comes from Jim Goss with Barrington Research.

Jim Goss -- Barrington Research -- Analyst

Thanks. A couple more things on the iPhone 12 capability with the vision capturing. Are you thinking the -- that capability is sufficient for the device we use more for professional content and that -- maybe it might be over to some extent for regular consumers? And also to the extent that you are pretty important to this, potentially to the iPhone 12 sales, do you think Apple is going to use Dolby Vision as one of their marketing capabilities that it's going to be push on it, given what they did do in their own show?

Lewis Chew -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

They could run an ad, Kevin.

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yes. Thanks Jim. So yes, one of the ads Apple has been running besides those I've seen it on stores does in fact highlight the ability to take professional quality video in Dolby Vision. And so to answer your question, it's both, I mean, there are -- many of the -- many themes that you've seen in movies actually have been -- many of them even shot with an iPhone. So the iPhone is a professional device and a consumer device and Dolby Vision brings out the best for both. So it's also a great way to capturing content. I mean, we've been trying it and it's amazing. And it looks more real and like what you experience. And so today you can -- I know at a minimum you can use it in the photos app, you could use it in iMovie, you can use it in the Clips. So we just look forward to supporting clubbing out the ecosystem of apps and services that can support it both for professional use and for consumers.

Jim Goss -- Barrington Research -- Analyst

Okay. And I think Atmos is included on the phones also, can headphones [Indecipherable] and take advantage of the Atmos capabilities? Or do they have to be a specially produced headphones?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Well, for Atmos playback, the iPhone supports iPhone playback, so to say, AirPods Pro. If you're asking about capture, we don't yet have capture, but there's always negative.

Jim Goss -- Barrington Research -- Analyst

Okay. One other thing on the Dolby Cinema installations. China has actually recovered a lot more quickly because of the lockdown capabilities they had. Are you seeing any pick up in the potential for installations to go on there versus other areas which are behind in this spread?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yeah. Well, we certainly had more discussion -- engagement in China, recently we had in many other parts of the world because as you say, they are opened and they've actually had some really good weak's [Phonetic] with local titles. So I would say of the parts of the world where we would still see some nearer term activity in that regard. Yes, China would be among that list. But overall, certainly we expect a lower pace of deployment for Dolby Cinemas screenings and equipment through the -- until we get to the other side of this recovery. But, yes, China is definitely one of the markets that stand out as being better than the others.

Jim Goss -- Barrington Research -- Analyst

Does the vaccine news finally create any higher degree of conversation with the parties you're dealing with for either of US or Europe or elsewhere to create that light at the end of the tunnel where you can start talking again?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Well, I talk to partners in all of the markets and I think none of us know when the industry is going to recover. I mean, obviously most of our screens are actually opened, of course, attendance is affected by the attendance restrictions and the time of the title. So, yeah, I think that any news that could help with seeing that light at the end of the tunnel, obviously, is great. I think most of all we do believe that studios are keep creating great movies and that there are audiences that are going to want to see [Indecipherable] they are going to see the best experiences. We just can't right now predict any better than anybody else when we're going to -- when that day is going to come.

Jim Goss -- Barrington Research -- Analyst

Okay. Thank you.

Lewis Chew -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Jim.

And we'll take our next question from Ivan Feinseth with Tigress Financial Partners.

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Ivan, are you on mute.

Ivan Feinseth -- Tigress Financial Partners -- Analyst

Sorry. Thank you for taking my call and congratulations on the great results in a difficult time. Did you start to work with Apple early on for the designing the iPhone 12 to incorporate Dolby Vision? And is there some things that are unique to the iPhone 12 that allow it to be in? Or will you be able to work with other phone manufacturers as well? And will we see this soon in some other brands?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Well, we have a long -- as you know, we have a long-standing relationship with Apple and they support Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos playback throughout their ecosystem. And so yeah, we've been working with them for some time to bring this experience to life. And our first focus is on making it a successful ecosystem. I mean, one thing, of course, that is true in Apple is that, they have all of the apps and the services and the devices and the entire ecosystem to bring an experience like this to life at scale. So job number one for us is to help them make that as successful as it could possibly be and to open up that ecosystem to other apps and services. And then from there, yes, so the time will certainly give an opportunity for this to be something that opens up new opportunities for us.

Ivan Feinseth -- Tigress Financial Partners -- Analyst

With other phone manufacturers as well?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Right.

Ivan Feinseth -- Tigress Financial Partners -- Analyst

Okay. Also in your decision to get out of conferencing, you mean just the conferencing hardware, you're still going to focus on implementing Dolby Voice into other conferencing products?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

That's right. We're still supporting our enterprise communications partners who are winding down the sale of the digital hardware for comp insurance.

Ivan Feinseth -- Tigress Financial Partners -- Analyst

And with the cash you have, when you think about acquisitions, is there any specific direction you envision like that you could extend your brand into?

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

Well, I think what we've been doing for the day has been in addition to expanding the presence of Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos across our existing categories. We see opportunities in new forms of content in gaming and music. But with Dolby.io, we are extending into all the ways in which we enjoy media and interactivity experiences. So when we think about acquisitions, it's through that lens. Are there opportunities that could accelerate or expand our opportunity? We don't look at it like we have this capital, so we need to go do an acquisition. And that's something that we're always -- we're obviously like any company, we're always looking at the opportunities that come our way.

Ivan Feinseth -- Tigress Financial Partners -- Analyst

Thank you very much, and good luck going forward.

Kevin J. Yeaman -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
