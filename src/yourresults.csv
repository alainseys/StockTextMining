Shares of sports betting company DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) jumped 10% at the open today, and remain 9% above yesterday's closing price as of 10:40 a.m. EST.

The company reported strong revenue growth on Friday, leading it to raise its fiscal year 2020 revenue guidance.

So what

DraftKings reported pro forma revenue growth of 42%, meaning it is comparing to the previous year as if its merger with SBTech (Global) Limited and Diamond Eagle Acquisition occurred on Jan. 1, 2019. The mergers culminated in the company's initial public offering (IPO) in April 2020.

In addition to raising 2020 revenue guidance by about 6% at the midpoint of given ranges, the company initiated fiscal 2021 guidance that implies about 45% year-over-year growth.

Now what

DraftKings is riding momentum from two recent events. First, the return of major sports leagues in the third quarter from pandemic-forced suspensions increased user activity. The company said its monthly unique payers (MUP) increased by 64% to over 1 million. And results from the U.S. election continued to add support for the sector. Sports betting ballot initiatives were passed in three more states, bringing the total to 21 states and Washington, D.C., where sports betting is legal in the U.S.

DraftKings is now live with mobile sports betting in 10 states after its launch in Tennessee this quarter. The company has also recently entered partnerships with Turner Sports and NFL teams including the Philadelphia Eagles and the New York Giants.

Investors are applauding the company's results today and its growth.

Many names that hit fresh highs a few weeks ago are in the market doghouse right now, but quality will eventually win the day on Wall Street.

Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG), DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG), and Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) are three stocks that have recently fallen at least 20% below their earlier highs. These are names that I expect will recover quickly. Here's why I'm bullish on these three briefly out-of-favor investments.

Datadog

One of this year's bigger winners reported fresh financials this week, and Wall Street wasn't impressed. Shares of the cloud-based provider of website uptime tracking, security monitoring, and a growing suite of analytical tools declined 6% on Wednesday after posting its third-quarter results, and the stock is now 26% below the all-time high it hit just four weeks ago.

The quarter had everything you would expect in an applause-worthy performance. The 61% increase in revenue and adjusted profit of $0.05 a share were comfortably ahead of the 50% top-line growth and $0.01 a share in net income that analysts targeted. Datadog boosted its outlook for all of 2020, and the guidance it initiated for the current quarter is also above where the pros are parked.

Datadog's streak of dollar-based net retention rate above 130% (the rate of returning customers who are spending at least 30% more on Datadog's offerings than a year before) now stretches to 13 consecutive quarters. Bears can argue that Datadog's valuation was stretched when it peaked last month, but with revenue growth outpacing expectations, the bullish counter is that the multiple will keep retracting organically even as the stock bounces back in the near future.

DraftKings

I have a love-hate relationship with DraftKings as an investment, but there's no denying that it's the top dog in wagering on fantasy sports. More importantly, DraftKings is using that pole position as a Trojan horse to get its more traditional sportsbook betting platform into our heads. DraftKings has been brokering deals with leading sports networks, and it's going to pay off a lot sooner than you think.

Investors were hopping onto DraftKings stock over the summer and early fall as pro sports leagues across the country restarted their seasons, but investors who once bet on DraftKings are now wagering against the niche leader. The stock has fallen 35% since its early October highs as of Wednesday's close, and it's well positioned to crank out a blowout quarterly report on Friday morning. Revenue rose 24% for the quarter that ended in June, and that was without any of the major leagues in action. This is a classic pullback that could bounce back later this week if it's able to deliver a strong financial update.

Fastly

The hardest-hit of the three stocks here is Fastly. The next-gen content delivery network ranked as one of this year's biggest winners until it lowered its guidance four weeks ago, largely as a result of losing Tiktok as its largest customer.

Investors bailed on Fastly, which lost nearly half of its value after declining in 12 of the last 13 trading days of October. Fastly is now trading 47% below the all-time high it established in mid-October. Whenever a company slashes its guidance, it's going to raise red flags. Datadog this week showed us that even increasing your guidance sometimes isn't good enough.

However, the end result here is that Fastly is now roughly half the company it was a month ago in terms of market valuation. Even if TikTok doesn't come back -- and it was a big part of the business, constituting nearly 11% of its revenue through the first nine months of 2020 -- analysts see revenue growing by at least 30% in 2021.

Shares of Kensington Capital Acquisition (NYSE:KCAC) jumped 18% at the open Friday after the special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, said its pending merger with QuantumScape is nearing completion. QuantumScape is an early-stage company with a lot of potential and a lot of uncertainty, but investors appear excited by the chance to own its shares.

So what

Kensington Capital was formed earlier this year as a so-called blank-check company, which is a shell that goes public and then merges with an existing business. SPACs have been a popular route to the public markets this year, with Virgin Galactic Holdings, DraftKings, and Nikola among the companies that have gone public that way in the last 12 months.

Kensington in early September announced plans to merge with QuantumScape, which is working to develop a solid-state lithium-metal battery for electric vehicles and other applications. In theory, solid-state designs hold a lot of advantages over the lithium-ion batteries now in use because they are more stable and offer greater energy density than what is available today.

The higher density should mean more miles per charge, and with fewer batteries needed, it should reduce the weight of electric vehicles. But for all the potential in solid-state batteries, it has proved tricky to try to commercialize them.

Investors seem to have an appetite to accept the risk that comes with this nascent technology. The shares are up on Friday after Kensington Capital announced that shareholders will be asked to vote on the merger on Nov. 25, meaning the deal could close in the weeks to come.

Now what

One needs to look no further than what has happened with Nikola to see the risks that come with investing in early-stage technologies via a SPAC. That said, there is a lot to like about QuantumScape.

Bill Gates is an investor, as is one-time Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief technology officer J.B. Straubel, who is on QuantumScape's board. Straubel has said he believes ""the company has an opportunity to redefine the battery landscape.""

Perhaps most important, QuantumScape counts automaker Volkswagen (OTC:VWAGY) as both an investor and a customer. Volkswagen wants to be a leader in electric vehicles, creating a huge potential market for QuantumScape batteries.

Assuming all goes to plan, QuantumScape will soon trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker QS. It's still early days, and some caution is warranted, but there is good reason for investors to be excited.",draftkings,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.899, 'pos': 0.101, 'compound': 0.4215}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.899, 'pos': 0.101, 'compound': 0.4215}]",0.4215,0.0,0.4215,0.28099999999999997,Somewhat Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive
