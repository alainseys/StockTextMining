It's also the first time the company has started a hardware generation by launching two consoles with different performance tiers.

The high-powered Xbox Series X retails at $499, while the entry-level Xbox Series S is priced at $300. Both appear to be sold out and could remain hard to find heading into the Thanksgiving holiday. The Series X is in particularly high demand, with consoles currently fetching over $1,000 per unit on eBay.

What do Xbox Series X and Series S mean for Microsoft?

Microsoft's new Xbox systems appear to be enjoying a strong debut, but they won't get much of a head start. Sony is set to launch its PlayStation 5 console in the U.S. on Nov. 12.

The Series X is Microsoft's most powerful console ever, and significantly more powerful than Sony's PlayStation 5 by most accounts. However, Microsoft appears to be pursuing a broader software and services strategy this time around instead of prioritizing a single hardware platform.

The company is making a big effort to promote its Netflix-like subscription-service, Xbox Game Pass. It's also looking to make its big-budget games and overall subscription library accessible through its xCloud streaming service.

The lower-priced Series S console is still powerful compared to previous Xboxes, but it's much weaker than the Series X. The level of difference reflects Microsoft's goal of building a bigger gaming ecosystem. With the company also making its premium content available across PC and streaming-based mobile platforms, this hardware cycle already looks very different.",microsoft,msft,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.805, 'pos': 0.195, 'compound': 0.5187}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.805, 'pos': 0.195, 'compound': 0.5187}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.25935,0.0,0.25935,0.17290000000000003,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Positive,Neutral,Somewhat Positive
GameStop to Buy Back More Than 60% of Its 2021 Bonds Early,Motley Fool,5 days ago,The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Microsoft. The Motley Fool recommends GameStop and recommends the following options: long January 2021 ...,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/11/gamestop-to-buy-back-more-than-60-of-its-2021-bond/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","The shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME) jumped approximately 4% yesterday after the company issued a press release saying it's buying back roughly 63% of its outstanding 2021 senior notes early. GameStop will voluntarily redeem the bonds, which are 6.75% senior notes, on Dec. 11 of this year, paying the principal amount plus interest up to that date.

The buyback, which amounts to $125 million in principal, is being carried out because GameStop has ""remained steadfast in our focus on creating a more efficient business model,"" CFO Jim Bell said in a company statement. He added the company is using its increased cash ""to reduce our outstanding debt"" and said this event ""is reflective of our success in transforming our business model.""

GameStop has experienced a long decline since its most recent peak from 2013 through 2015, but has made something of a comeback since its COVID-19 lows in March 2020. Among other changes, it recently forged a deal with Microsoft to receive a cut of all digital game purchases made through the gaming consoles it sells.

Investors also reacted positively to hedge fund Senvest Management buying a 5.54% stake in GameStop. Senvest's Richard Mashaal said his fund looks for ""out of favor, unloved, misunderstood, and underappreciated companies where expectations, sentiment and valuations are all low"" and that within one to three years these companies have the potential to make a turnaround.

The company may also be generating some upbeat interest based on its planned Black Friday next-generation console sales.

Is Dropbox Stock a Buy?,Motley Fool,6 days ago,Box also offers business plans that start at just $5 per user each month. Dropbox and Box both face fierce competition from Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) OneDrive ...,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/11/is-dropbox-stock-a-buy/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX) went public in early 2018, but the cloud storage service provider's stock still remains below its IPO price of $21. Let's see why Dropbox was left behind as many other cloud service stocks rallied, and whether or not it's still worth buying.

An early mover in a crowded space

Dropbox and its main rival Box (NYSE:BOX) were both founded over a decade ago. Both companies operate ""freemium"" cloud storage services.

Dropbox's free tier provides individual users with 2GB of cloud storage. Individuals who pay $9.99 a month get 2TB of storage, or they can get family plans that split 2TB among up to six users for $16.99 a month. For enterprise users, Dropbox offers business plans that start at $12.50 per user each month.

Dropbox's plans are pricey relative to those of its industry peers. Box's free tier offers individuals 10GB of storage, and they can upgrade to 100GB for $10 a month. Box also offers business plans that start at just $5 per user each month.

Dropbox and Box both face fierce competition from Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) OneDrive and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Drive, which provide 5GB and 15GB of free cloud storage, respectively. Both tech giants can afford to undercut Dropbox and its peers to tether more users to their sprawling ecosystems.

Dropbox controls 21% of the cloud storage market, according to Datanyze, putting it in second place behind Google Drive (34%) and ahead of OneDrive (12%). Box ranks fifth with a 5% share.

Dropbox is a top cloud storage provider, but investors still seem concerned about the looming competition. But if we look at Dropbox's fundamentals, we'll notice it isn't being crushed in a crowded market.

Dropbox is still growing

Dropbox's revenue rose 14% year over year to $487.4 million in the third quarter. That marked a slight deceleration from its previous quarters, but it comfortably beat analysts' expectations by $3.8 million.

Moreover, Dropbox's number of paying users, average revenue per paying user (ARPPU), and its gross and operating margins all improved sequentially and year over year during the third quarter:

Metric Q3 2019 Q4 2019 Q1 2020 Q2 2020 Q3 2020 Revenue Growth (YOY) 19% 19% 18% 16% 14% Paying Users (Millions) 14.0 14.3 14.6 15.0 15.3 ARPPU $123.15 $125.00 $126.30 $126.88 $128.03 Gross Margin 76.7% 77.6% 78.3% 79.2% 80% Operating Margin 13.1% 15.6% 16.1% 20.6% 23%

Dropbox attributes that growth to its integration with other collaboration services -- including Zoom Video Communications, Microsoft Office, Slack, and salesforce.com -- which all benefited from remote work, online education, and other stay-at-home trends during the pandemic.

Other tools, including HelloSign for digital signatures and Dropbox Transfer for sending files, unite those services to make Dropbox a collaboration platform (instead of a basic cloud storage service) for many large companies. Dropbox and Box are also popular with companies that don't want to be locked into Microsoft and Google's prisoner-taking ecosystems.

Stable profit growth

Dropbox's expanding margins in the third quarter -- which it attributed to cost efficiency gains across its infrastructure hardware, more prudent spending during the pandemic, and a postponed brand campaign -- also indicate it will remain firmly profitable for the foreseeable future.

Dropbox's non-GAAP net income nearly doubled year over year to $110.2 million, or $0.26 per share, during the third quarter and beat estimates by seven cents. On a GAAP basis, it posted a profit of $32.7 million, compared to a net loss of $17 million a year earlier.

By comparison, Box is only profitable on a non-GAAP basis, and it expects to remain unprofitable on a GAAP basis for the full year. Therefore, economies of scale are seemingly kicking in for Dropbox, but not for Box.

Rosy guidance and a cheap valuation

Dropbox expects its fourth-quarter revenue to rise 11%-12% year over year with a non-GAAP operating margin of 22%-22.5%. That sequential contraction in its operating margin isn't surprising, since it shifted its planned brand campaign from the third to fourth quarters.

For the full year, Dropbox expects its revenue to rise 15%, versus its prior forecast for 14% growth, with a non-GAAP operating margin of ""approximately"" 20% -- compared to its previous guidance of 18%-18.5%.

Analysts expect Dropbox's revenue to rise 15% this year and 11% next year. On the bottom line, the company expects its non-GAAP earnings to grow 68% this year and 14% next year -- which are impressive growth rates for a stock that trades at just 21 times forward earnings.

Based on these facts, Dropbox looks like an undervalued growth stock. Investors shouldn't ignore the competition, but Dropbox's high market share, its consistent growth in users and ARPPU, and its expanding margins all indicate it will continue locking in enterprise customers.",microsoft,msft,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral
"8x8, Inc. Looks Cheap: Why This Cloud Communications Stock Could Be a Value Trap",Motley Fool,6 days ago,"The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Five9, Microsoft, Twilio, and Zoom Video Communications and recommends the following options: long January ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/11/8x8-inc-looks-cheap-why-this-cloud-communications/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","No matter how the coronavirus pandemic pans out, the world will remain hungry for cloud communication services. And investors may struggle to find stocks at a reasonable price to get exposure to such an attractive industry. With its low valuation ratios relative to its peers, the cloud communications specialist 8x8 (NASDAQ:EGHT) looks like an exception, though. Yet investors should stay prudent, as the stock could become a value trap.

8x8 seems cheap

Thanks to acquisitions and internal developments, 8x8 has built a comprehensive cloud communications portfolio that includes unified communications, video conferencing, and contact center solutions. In addition, the company proposes APIs (application programming interfaces) for enterprises to integrate communication services such as SMS into their applications.

Given its broad offerings, 8x8 addresses a large market that management estimated at more than $60 billion. But the competition looks scary: It includes many high-growth companies such as the unified communication players Zoom and RingCentral, virtual contact center outfit Five9, and communications API specialist Twilio.

As a result of its expanding businesses, 8x8 more than doubled its revenue from $209.3 million in fiscal 2016 to $446.2 million in fiscal 2020, ending on March 31.

And with its market cap at 3.9 times trailing 12-month revenue, the company seems valued at an attractive discount. The stocks of 8x8's competitors RingCentral, Five9, and Twilio are trading at much higher price-to-sales ratios in the range of 22 to 26. And Zoom remains in its own league with its stellar ratio of 91.

A justified discount

A part of 8x8's significant discount relative to its peers is due to its lower top-line growth, as the company didn't manage to take advantage of the coronavirus-induced surge in cloud communications. During the last quarter, revenue increased 17.9% year over year to $129.1 million, which paled in comparison to Zoom's extraordinary last-quarter revenue growth of 335%. And 8x8 also lagged RingCentral's, Five9's, and Twilio's revenue growth of 30.1%, 33.9%, and 51.8%, respectively.

Looking forward, management anticipates fiscal Q3 revenue growth to decelerate to a range of 11% to 12%. That outlook may need an update because of the potential implications of Pfizer's and BioNTech's coronavirus vaccine candidate, though. But in any case, the forecast low-double-digit revenue growth isn't likely to improve should the threat of the coronavirus wane, which would reduce the need for remote communications.

In addition, 8x8 has yet to improve its profitability. Its various products involve elevated research and development and sales and marketing expenses relative to its modest revenue base to remain competitive.

Granted, the X Series platform released in 2018 to cross-sell the company's different solutions has been gaining traction. As an illustration, 22 out of the 48 new deals with annual recurring revenue above $100,000 during the last quarter involved up-selling or cross-selling opportunities. But cost synergies didn't materialize yet: Despite revenue growth during fiscal Q2, losses of $38.4 million barely changed compared to the prior-year quarter losses of $40.9 million.

During the last earnings call, management expressed confidence in improving profitability thanks to its updated go-to-market strategy that involves a broader set of partners to acquire customers at a lower cost. However, that will require solid execution in the context of intensifying competition. For instance, Twilio recently released a free version of its API video offering, and tech giants Microsoft and Cisco Systems have both been improving their respective communication platforms Microsoft Teams and Webex to keep up with Zoom's innovations.

A potential value trap

Besides its operational challenges, 8x8 must also deal with a less-than-ideal balance sheet that could involve expensive refinancing during economic uncertainties. At the end of the last quarter, total debt exceeded cash, restricted cash, and investments by $124.9 million, while the company has yet to generate positive free cash flow.

Thus, despite 8x8's apparently attractive valuation relative to its peers, investors should keep in mind that management must provide flawless execution against solid competitors for the cloud communications stock to not become a value trap.",microsoft,msft,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.146, 'neu': 0.701, 'pos': 0.153, 'compound': 0.0258}]","[{'neg': 0.104, 'neu': 0.681, 'pos': 0.215, 'compound': 0.2732}]","[{'neg': 0.104, 'neu': 0.681, 'pos': 0.215, 'compound': 0.2732}]",0.2732,0.0129,0.2732,0.18643333333333334,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Positive,Neutral,Somewhat Positive
2 Growth Stocks I'd Buy Right Now,Motley Fool,6 days ago,"... boosting results at Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which provides the custom processors for Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/11/2-growth-stocks-id-buy-right-now/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","With the S&P 500 index flirting with new highs, some growth stocks are trading at frothy valuations, which could limit near-term upside. But there are still good opportunities out there if you know where to look.

The video game industry is a ripe field to look for ideas right now. The new consoles launching this holiday are already boosting results at Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which provides the custom processors for Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X.

Another way to invest in gaming is Logitech International (NASDAQ:LOGI), which makes essential gaming peripherals, such as joysticks, keyboards, and headsets, and has been reporting tremendous sales growth this year.

Here's why these two growth stocks still have room to run.

1. Advanced Micro Devices is turning up the heat

AMD stock price has climbed 137% over the last year. Those impressive gains come on the back of significant market share gains against Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). AMD has become a leader in high-performance computing under the leadership of CEO Lisa Su, but the company is just hitting its stride.

Strong demand for Ryzen, EPYC, and semi-custom processors, which includes shipments for the new consoles, drove revenue up 56% year over year in the third quarter. AMD said it gained market share against Intel in the client CPU market for the 12th straight quarter.

While Intel has struggled with delays in developing its seven-nanometer processor, AMD is moving quickly to stretch its lead. Team Red is already preparing to ship its next-generation Milan server processors based on the newest Zen 3 core, which are on track to ship this quarter.

AMD is also going after NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) lead in graphics processing units (GPUs) with the new Radeon RX 6000 series of graphics cards launching this quarter, powered by its RDNA 2 technology. These are the most powerful gaming cards AMD has ever built. While NVIDIA has long dominated the high-end gaming card market, AMD may begin chipping away at Team Green's lead in the short term.

The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X are also being powered by RDNA 2 chips. AMD's enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment revenue made up 40% of total revenue last quarter and more than doubled year over year. AMD expects semi-custom shipments to increase sequentially in the fourth quarter based on strong demand for the new consoles.

AMD has another catalyst on the horizon with its announced acquisition of Xilinx for $35 billion. The deal will extend AMD's market reach to computing platforms for end devices in the cloud.

The shares are highly valued at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 68, but AMD is worth paying up for, given its market share gains against mighty Intel, and the prospects of further growth in console and PC gaming chips. Management expects revenue to grow approximately 41% for the full year, which makes the high valuation look less expensive.

2. Logitech is flying under the radar

Logitech is benefiting from enormous tailwinds. Video calls are replacing audio, while esports and streaming are driving demand for gaming accessories, such as headsets and gaming mice, and PC webcams. In the last quarter, total sales surged 75% year over year. High demand boosted margins, sending earnings per share up 274% over the year-ago quarter.

The growth of content creation and live game streaming on YouTube, Twitch, and other platforms is fueling demand for Logitech's PC peripherals, which drove sales for the category up 57% year over year excluding currency.

Logitech has enjoyed an acceleration in sales this year due to more people working and playing games at home. But these trends were already driving growth in Logitech's business long before the coronavirus arrived. Gaming sales increased from $312 million in fiscal 2017 to $690 million in fiscal 2020 (which ended in March).

Logitech also has a growth opportunity supplying office conference rooms with video products. ""Virtually, all meeting rooms will be video-enabled over the coming years as more companies adopt video more broadly,"" CEO Bracken Darrell said during the conference call in October. Sales of video collaboration products have nearly tripled over the last three years.

Management doesn't see the secular growth trends in gaming and video ending anytime soon, which is good news for investors, given that the stock seems to be under investors' radar. Despite the strong operating results, the stock trades at just 20 times forward earnings estimates. That leaves a lot of headroom for this growth stock to climb both in the short and long term.",microsoft,msft,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.435, 'pos': 0.565, 'compound': 0.3818}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.82, 'pos': 0.18, 'compound': 0.5267}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.82, 'pos': 0.18, 'compound': 0.5267}]",0.5267,0.1909,0.5267,0.4147666666666667,Positive,Positive,Somewhat Positive,Positive
How the Nasdaq Dominated the Stock Market Wednesday,Motley Fool,5 days ago,"... at top stocks in the Nasdaq-100 Index, it's hard to argue that the prospects for Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook hinge on what happens with the coronavirus.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/11/how-nasdaq-dominated-the-stock-market-wednesday/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","After so many months of absolutely crushing the rest of the stock market, the recent underperformance from the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) has raised some eyebrows. Even though the Nasdaq was closest to setting new record highs as the stock market surged last week, it has hung back even as other market benchmarks moved more sharply higher.

At least for today, though, the Nasdaq decided it had had enough. Wednesday featured a return to the strong gains that Nasdaq investors have grown accustomed to seeing, even as the rest of the market took a pause. Here's why the Nasdaq is doing so well on Wednesday and what it means for the rest of 2020 and beyond.

Investors hedge their bets

A big part of the pessimism among Nasdaq investors in recent days has been the assumption that much of the index's gains have been attributable to growth stocks that capitalized on new opportunities brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, stay-at-home tech stocks have been huge winners in 2020, and investors seemed ready to take profits as soon as news of a possible coronavirus vaccine came out earlier this week.

Yet today, investors look like they're taking a more realistic view of the situation. Even if a vaccine proves to be effective, it'll still take months to navigate accelerated approval procedures and get it distributed to the public at large. During that time, public health officials are worried that a massive surge in COVID-19 cases could prompt a return to shutdowns and other more extreme measures to control the spread of the disease.

More than just stay-at-home stocks

More importantly, the assumption that Nasdaq strength has come only from stay-at-home trends is incorrect. The trend toward corporate adoption of technological advances was already well established long before the coronavirus crisis began, and the end of COVID-19 won't halt those digital adoption efforts.

Just looking at top stocks in the Nasdaq-100 Index, it's hard to argue that the prospects for Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook hinge on what happens with the coronavirus. Even e-commerce giant Amazon.com will have plenty of opportunities to grow even once shoppers everywhere can feel safe returning to malls and other stores.

Be ready for volatility

Nevertheless, with such high expectations for many stocks, investors have to be ready for big drops. That's what happened with data analytics company Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG), as a solid quarterly report featuring greater than 60% revenue growth year over year and a much better adjusted profit than expected still met with disappointment from shareholders. Datadog was down as much as 14% on Wednesday before recovering some of its lost ground.

In the long run, these violent stock-price fluctuations give way to smoother moves based more heavily on fundamental business performance. That can be almost impossible to see on a day-to-day basis, but if you can be patient, the longer-term trends will assert themselves in time.

The Nasdaq may have dominated the rest of the stock market on Wednesday, but that doesn't mean investors have decided once and for all that tech stocks are the place for high-growth investors to be right now. The lesson to learn today is that what happens one day in the stock market can reverse the next and then move back in the original direction after that. Having a consistent strategy will keep you from getting whipsawed amid all the bumps in the road.",microsoft,msft,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.123, 'neu': 0.747, 'pos': 0.13, 'compound': 0.0516}]","[{'neg': 0.123, 'neu': 0.747, 'pos': 0.13, 'compound': 0.0516}]",0.0516,0.0,0.0516,0.0344,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral
"For Market-Beating Investments, Look at Brand Value",Motley Fool,6 days ago,"Apple, Amazon.com, Microsoft, and Alphabet, for example, are among the top companies with the greatest market value. A 2019 study by Gregor Dorfleitner, ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/11/for-market-beating-investments-look-at-brand-value/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","If people like you, they will listen to you, but if they trust you, they'll do business with you. -- Zig Ziglar

That quotation from sales guru Zig Ziglar is all about brands. Many investors don't pay much attention to brands, and that can be a mistake, because a strong brand can be a strong competitive advantage for a company, driving market-beating results.

Thinking about brands

Try a thought experiment: Imagine that you can book a flight on either of two airlines, for the same price. One is Southwest Airlines, and one is Sky Coach. You'll probably choose Southwest, right? That's because you're familiar with it and have a reasonably good (or even great) opinion of the company, too. That's the power of its brand, at work.

Next, imagine that you want to watch a movie with your kids. Your options are a movie from Disney or a movie from Screen Magic. If that's all you know about the films, you'll likely go with the Disney offering -- because its strong brand will have you assuming that the movie will be made to high standards. If you want to send money to someone, will you prefer to use PayPal, Venmo (which belongs to PayPal), or a newcomer on the scene, ZipZipFunds? The better-known -- and better-trusted -- names will be favored.

Imagine that you want to own and run a restaurant. You might open a small business of your own, but alternatively, you might buy a franchise. One option isn't necessarily better than the other, but the franchise offers the benefit of a known brand. Good or bad, consumers will probably be familiar with the brand, and will have an opinion of it. If you start a McDonald's franchise location, or one for Subway or Dunkin' or Taco Bell, on the first day that you're open, consumers will immediately know what items you sell and what they think of them. Many will be fans of your offerings and will become customers.

Companies without strong brands can still succeed, but they will have to work harder to get the attention of consumers. Meanwhile, companies with strong brands will not only win business, but they'll often be able to charge higher prices for their offerings, as people will frequently pay up for brands they prefer. Plenty of blue-chip companies have strong brands that helped them achieve blue-chip status.

The most valuable brands

Once you respect the power of brands, you'll likely find brand rankings of interest -- and you'll be in luck, because there are many such lists. Here are the top recent results from one annual ranking -- Interbrand's 2020 Best Global Brands.

Rank Company Value of Brand 1 Apple $323 billion 2 Amazon.com $201 billion 3 Microsoft $166 billion 4 Google (parent Alphabet) $165 billion 5 Samsung $62 billion 6 Coca-Cola $57 billion 7 Toyota $52 billion 8 Mercedes-Benz (parent Daimler) $49 billion 9 McDonald's $43 billion 10 Disney $41 billion 11 BMW (parent BMW AG) $40 billion 12 Intel $37 billion 13 Facebook $35 billion 14 IBM $35 billion 15 Nike $34 billion

The list above makes it clear that great companies tend to have great brands, and that focusing on top brands can lead to market-beating results. Apple, Amazon.com, Microsoft, and Alphabet, for example, are among the top companies with the greatest market value. A 2019 study by Gregor Dorfleitner, Felix Rößle, and Kathrin Lesser titled ""The financial performance of the most valuable brands: a global empirical investigation"" found that ""the most valuable brands outperform the market during the overall period from 2000 to June 2018 as well as during different market conditions."" It also found, though, that much of the outperformance stemmed mainly from certain industries: business services, retail, sporting goods, and technology.

It's worth looking at such lists of brand value now and then, to see how companies in which you're invested (or in which you want to invest) are ranked, brand-wise. Note, too, how their rankings change over time. Interbrand's 2020 list, for example, showed Amazon.com's brand value surging by 60%, while Apple's jumped by 38%. Google's dropped by 1%, though, while Disney's slipped by 8%.

Brand value can rise or fall due to how well-received new products are, how wide the company's global reach is, and how well a company is competing with rivals, among other things. The folks at Interbrand explain their methodology: ""There are three key components to all of our valuations: an analysis of the financial performance of the branded products or services, of the role the brand plays in purchase decisions, and of the brand's competitive strength.""

Of course, brand value should never be the only metric of interest when you're evaluating a company, but it's worth including it among the factors you consider. A strong brand can give a company a nice tailwind as it grows.",microsoft,msft,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.714, 'pos': 0.286, 'compound': 0.34}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.625, 'pos': 0.375, 'compound': 0.8126}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.625, 'pos': 0.375, 'compound': 0.8126}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.4063,0.34,0.4063,0.38420000000000004,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive
Atlassian Is Going All-In on Cloud,Motley Fool,1 week ago,"... benefit of this version is that it is ""cloud-ready"" and can be migrated to third-party clouds such as Microsoft's Azure and/or Amazon Web Services (AWS) easily.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/10/atlassian-is-going-all-in-on-cloud/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) is riding the trend of digital transformation, with its team-productivity software driving its stock up more than 60% this year. Given this momentum, some may have been surprised when the company made an announcement that would disrupt a large set of its important customers: It is ending support for its server products that customers have installed in their own data centers.

Let's take a closer look at what's actually happening here and what it might mean for investors.

What's going on?

Customers have three ways they can install Atlassian's software for users. The most popular option is its cloud-based offerings, which 95% of new customers choose because of the easy start-up, automatic upgrades, and scalability. A second option is a server version that allows customers to install the software in their own data centers and control when software upgrades happen. The company will be ending its support for this version in the coming years. Management estimates that 30,000 customers (out of 182,000-plus) and 75% of the user base will be affected.

But for customers who aren't quite ready to commit to the cloud, the third option may be appealing. Its data center products are somewhat of a hybrid of the previous options and provide many of the benefits of cloud (scalability, high availability, and disaster recovery) but with the benefit of on-premise control of hardware, data, and the upgrade cycle. Another benefit of this version is that it is ""cloud-ready"" and can be migrated to third-party clouds such as Microsoft's Azure and/or Amazon Web Services (AWS) easily. The product is priced like a cloud-based subscription with monthly fees and maintenance and support bundled in.

As customers make decisions on how to proceed, the Atlassian team is committed to ensuring its customers are supported and happy.

Taking care of customers

A core value at Atlassian is ""Don't #@!% the customer,"" and that certainly applies here. The company is going out of its way to ensure customers have a smooth transition. It is providing free migration kits along with substantial documentation on how to ensure a successful migration. Any customer on a maintenance plan gets free access to cloud versions of the software to enable testing before they make the big switch. Additionally, customers transitioning with more than 1,000 users will receive discounts over the first three years using the cloud: 55% discount for year one, 40% for year two, and 20% for year three.

Customers will also have plenty of time to switch. Here's the timeline.

Feb. 2, 2021: New license sales will stop and on-premise prices will increase 15%

Feb. 2, 2022: Upgrades will end for server licenses

Feb. 2, 2024: End of support for all server products

With all of this going on, Atlassian's financials will see some changes over the next few years.

Caution: Financial statement road work ahead

Today Atlassian reports its revenue in four different segments shown in the table below.

Metric Q1 FY2021 revenue % of total revenue Year-over-year growth Subscription $278 million 60% 38% Maintenance $128 million 28% 16% Perpetual license $22 million 5% (11%) Other $32 million 7% 15% Total $460 million 100% 26%

Each one of these product segments will be affected by the transition to the cloud. Let's look at what management indicated would happen to each as the transition unfolds.

Subscription revenue: This includes fees generated by its cloud-based and data center products. This will continue to grow at a rapid pace as new customers join the Atlassian fold and existing customers migrate to the cloud or the data center products. The growth of this segment should accelerate as existing server customers start paying monthly subscription fees.

Maintenance revenue: This segment is related to customer support costs for the server products that are being sunset. Management indicated that revenue is expected to remain flat going into next year. This category will eventually go to zero as customers move away from the server products over the next three years.

Perpetual license revenue: This is the licensing costs for its server products and will decline by approximately 50% in the coming year. Starting in February, prices will increase by 15%, but that will only encourage customers to move to the cloud. As legacy customers move to subscription-based pricing, it won't totally offset the loss in perpetual license and maintenance revenue.

Other revenue: This category is related to the fees the company receives from its third-party application marketplace. Management indicated that this category is expected to be flat going into the next year.

Other financial effects: In addition to the above-mentioned revenue changes, the company will also see declines in free cash flow, gross margin, and operating margin. As the company incurs costs related to the transition without higher revenue, margins will be squeezed, and as lump-sum payments for perpetual licenses decrease, cash flow will decline too. These changes may seem concerning for investors, but the company is on solid financial footing and is in a great position to embark on this transition that will enable it to emerge even stronger on the other side.

The bottom line for investors

Atlassian's leadership is simplifying its product lineup to ""double down"" on its cloud strategy. This move will enable its product development team to be more efficient and provide more value to customers over the long term. The road ahead won't be without some minor bumps and scrapes, but the company is committed to ensuring that customers transition successfully.

Understanding the details behind this transition should make shareholders more comfortable with management's plan and its commitment to the long-term success of the company. As a shareholder, I'm looking forward to watching Atlassian's progress as it goes all-in on the cloud, and I won't be selling this growth stock anytime soon.",microsoft,msft,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.772, 'pos': 0.228, 'compound': 0.7269}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.772, 'pos': 0.228, 'compound': 0.7269}]",0.7269,0.0,0.7269,0.4846,Positive,Very Positive,Neutral,Very Positive

Prepared Remarks:

Operator

Good afternoon, and welcome to Zix's third-quarter 2020 earnings conference call. My name is Christian, and I will be your operator today. Joining us for today's presentation are the company's president and CEO, David Wagner, CFO, David Rockvam; and vice president of marketing, Geoff Bibby. Following the remarks, we will open up the call for your questions.

[Operator instructions.] Now I will turn the call over to Geoff Bibby. Sir, please proceed.

Geoff Bibby -- Vice President of Marketing

Thank you, Christian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our Q3 2020 earnings conference call. On the call today, we have our CEO, Dave Wagner, our CFO, Dave Rockvam. After the market closed today, we issued a press release announcing our results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020, a copy of which is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at zix.com.

Please note that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. It's important to note that the company undertakes no obligation to update such statements. We caution you to consider risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements contained in today's press release and in this call.

The risk factors section in our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q with the SEC provide examples of those risks. As more fully described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. The company has been actively monitoring the COVID-19 situation and its impact on both the company and the world in which we operate. The impact of COVID-19 and the unprecedented measures prevented spread are affecting our business in various ways, causing volatility and demand for our products change in customer behavior, including their spending payment patterns, disruptions in the operations of suppliers and partners and our employees' ability to work and travel.

We expect the ultimate significance of the impact will be dictated by the length of time that these circumstances continue, which will depend on the currently unknowable extend and duration of COVID-19 pandemic. These factors also make it more challenging for management to estimate the future performance of our business, particularly over the near-term. During the call today, we'll present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from , a substitute for or superior to our GAAP results.

We encourage you to consider all measures when analyzing the company's performance. A reconciliation of certain GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's press release, which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our site. Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave Wagner for his opening remarks. Dave?

Dave Wagner -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Geoff. Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Our solid results for the third quarter demonstrate our team's continued commitment to driving profitable growth, as well as our partners and end customers' adoption of our Secure Cloud platform. Delivering 15% revenue growth, coupled with 25% adjusted EBITDA margins in the quarter demonstrates the growing value Zix is providing our partners through our Secure Cloud platform.

Secure Cloud delivers comprehensive digital productivity, security and compliance solutions for businesses of all sizes. Today, I'm also pleased to announce that we're taking our commitment a step further through our acquisition of CloudAlly, an industry leader in Cloud-based data backup and recovery. Founded in 2011, CloudAlly offers a robust suite of award winning, ISO 27001 certified and GDPR, HIPAA compliant solutions for Microsoft Office 365, Google Workspace, SharePoint, OneDrive, Salesforce, Box and Dropbox. If you haven't gone through the related press release we issued this afternoon announcing the acquisition, I would encourage you to do so for further transaction specifics and commentary.

At a high level, CloudAlly expands our product suite into Microsoft Office 365 backup and recovery. Filling a growing demand from AppRiver's MSP channel as well as Zix's value-added reseller and direct sales channels. Like Zix, CloudAlly is a channel first provider serving more than 5000 customers and 250,000 unique users globally, collectively served by 600 MSP partners. Our two companies have highly complementary and synergistic go-to-market motions and end markets with virtually no overlap in our MSP partner base.

Most importantly, our combination with CloudAlly will enable us to directly address and capitalize on the growing Cloud backup and recovery market, which is expected to reach more than $3 billion annually by 2025 according to industry analysts. Zix's transformation continues to achieve new heights, and we believe this acquisition will enable us to accelerate our growth even further. Now I will turn our call over to our CFO, Dave Rockvam, to provide details on our financial results for the quarter. After his remarks, I will return to discuss our core growth drivers, Cloud Ally and our new chief product officer.

Dave?

Dave Rockvam -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. At a high level, in the third quarter, we again delivered on our commitment to drive incremental ARR, revenue and adjusted EBITDA dollar growth. We also produced strong cash flow from operations, generating $15.1 million, bringing the total amount of cash flow from operations to $24.2 million on a year-to-date basis. Looking at our numbers for the quarter in more detail.

At the end of Q3, our ARR totaled $222.3 million, up 11% from Q3 of last year. Our continued and sustained ARR growth is being driven by our customers' move to secure modern workplace, which puts significant emphasis on Cloud adoption. We are pleased that our Cloud-based ARR grew by 19% over Q3 of last year and now comprised 86% of total ARR of $190.3 million. New customers in the quarter totaled over 4500; up 22% from Q3 of last year.

For the third quarter, we had just over 99% net dollar retention, which represents our renewals plus new sales into the installed base divided by the renewals that were available at the beginning of the quarter. We continue to be pleased that in this unprecedented environment, we were able to grow our ARR at a double-digit rate and maintain good retention rates with our customers. Which we believe demonstrates the mission-critical role that our solutions fill with our customers. Dave will provide more color on our net dollar retention in the context of our growth drivers shortly.

Revenue for the third quarter increased 15% to $54.8 million from $47.8 million in the same quarter last year. The $54.8 million of revenue exceeds our guidance range for the third quarter. In Q3, we continued to see the momentum from the Q2 launch of Secure Cloud with nearly all new customers on the MSP side of the business on-boarding onto the new platform, while on the ZixDirect and partner side, we saw 88% of all new customers onboard onto Secure Cloud. October continued that momentum with Secure Cloud on-boarding on the Zix side at 97%.

Secure Cloud customers now consume 1.29 services per mailbox; which is up from 1.26 in Q2 2020. In total, our customers averaged 1.1 services per customer. So we know when we get them on to Secure Cloud, they consume more services. We think this bodes well for our strategy of providing a strong user-friendly platform that makes it easy to add more Zix solutions; ultimately making us more valuable and stickier to our partners and customers.

Shifting back to the P&L. Our adjusted gross profit for the quarter was $29.5 million or 53.8% of total revenue, which was an improvement on a dollar basis from $28.5 million or 59.6% of total revenue in the third quarter of last year. On a quarter-over-quarter percentage basis, this is down from 54.7% last quarter due to the continued strong growth of Office 365 products, which carry lower margin than most of our Zix IP-based products. Our adjusted R&D expenses for the third quarter of 2020 were $5.2 million or 9.5% of total revenue compared to $4.8 million or 10% of total revenue in Q3 of last year.

The year-over-year dollar increase for the quarter was primarily due to certain development projects, which we completed in 2020, and we are now beginning to amortize into expenses. Because the majority of our solutions are now Cloud-based, we continue to capitalize a meaningful portion of our development effort. As we move -- as we see more of these projects going to production, we will continue to see increases in our amortization. This growth in amortization will not impact our EBITDA, but it will have an impact on overall R&D expense and net income.

In the near-term, we don't expect to be increasing R&D headcount, but would expect to see R&D increase on an expense dollar basis compared to a cash spend basis. Our adjusted selling and marketing expenses for the quarter were $9.7 million or 17.6% of total revenue compared to $9.5 million or 19.9% of total revenue in Q3 of last year. The lower selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue reflects the benefits of our lower cost of customer acquisition from our high velocity sales model and the success we are having, winning new customers and wallet share gains from our more than 4450 active MSP partners. For the third quarter of 2020, our adjusted general and administrative expenses were $3.4 million or 6.2% of total revenue, which was down from $4.6 million or 9.6% of total revenue reported in Q3 of last year.

Much of this decrease was associated with the cost actions we took in April of this year and the continued vigilance on expense management. On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss of $725,000 versus a loss of $1.6 million in Q3 of last year. On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of a loss of $3 million or a loss of $0.05 per fully diluted share. The $0.05 loss for the quarter compares to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of a loss of $3.7 million or a loss of $0.07 per fully diluted share in Q3 of last year.

Our third quarter non-GAAP adjusted net income before deemed dividends and acquisition-related expenses and excluding deferred tax was $9.2 million or $0.17 per fully diluted share, which is $0.01 above our guidance. This compares to $6.7 million or $0.13 per fully diluted share we reported in Q3 of last year. And finally, our adjusted EBITDA for Q3 2020 totaled $13.8 million; an increase of 19.9% from the $11.5 million we reported in Q3 of last year. As a percentage of total revenue, adjusted EBITDA for Q3 2020 was 25.1% compared to 24% in Q4 of last year, Q3 of last year.

We had a really strong cash flow generation quarter. In Q3 2020, we generated $15.1 million of cash flow from operations, which was up 128% or $8.5 million over Q3 last year. For the nine-month period, we generated $24.2 million of cash flow from operations; an increase of 205% or $16.3 million over the same period last year. Capex and other intangibles for the third quarter of 2020 were $4.7 million, which consisted primarily of normal business capital purchases and capitalized internal use software development.

We expect capex and other intangibles to be approximately $18 million to $19 million for the full year 2020. We also expect adjusted depreciation and amortization to be approximately $9.2 million for the full year 2020. Billings, another measure of the health and growth of our business totaled $54.6 million for the third quarter of 2020; up 18% from $46.2 million in Q3 of last year. Turning to our balance sheet.

We ended the quarter with $23.7 million in cash, an increase of 68% or $9.6 million from $14.1 million at the end of the prior sequential quarter. In addition to our strong cash position, we also currently have $25 million available for borrowing through our revolving credit facility. This year, we have reacquired or canceled approximately $2.7 million of our own shares as part of our employee equity awards program, which does consume our cash but helps to limit dilution. Switching gears to the acquisition of CloudAlly, which we announced earlier today.

In addition to the market opportunity, which Dave will touch on momentarily, we expect CloudAlly to be highly accretive from a financial perspective. It's 100% subscription business and favorable profitability profile provide us with a predictable adjusted EBITDA and cash flow to augment our already robust financial base. For the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020, CloudAlly is projected to generate a stand-alone basis approximately $8 million in ARR. And at the end of 2021, we expect them to be on a quarterly EBITDA run rate of $500,000 per quarter.

In connection with the acquisition, we modified our existing senior secured term loan by adding additional borrowings of $35 million, bringing the total outstanding debt under our credit facility to $212.2 million. The maturity date remains February 20, 2024, and carries the same interest rate; currently LIBOR plus 3.25%, which is subject to future step-downs as leverage reduces. Additionally, we used a portion of the additional term loan borrowing to repay all existing draws under the revolving credit facility, which will leave us with $25 million of capacity under the revolver. On a pro forma basis, taking into effect the CloudAlly acquisition as of December 31, 2020, we expect to have more than $20 million of cash and cash equivalents and total debt under the credit facility of $212.1 million at the end of 2020.

Longer term, our strong unlevered free cash flow generating capabilities, aided by CloudAlly, will reliably allow us to service our debt obligations and execute our growth strategy. Now turning to our financial guidance, which is based on current market conditions and expectations and is subject to various important cautionary factors, including risks and uncertainties associated with COVID-19 pandemic. For the fourth quarter of 2020, which includes partial contribution from CloudAlly, we currently expect revenue to range between $56.4 million and $57.4 million, which includes approximately $1 million of contribution from our acquisition of CloudAlly on November 5, 2020, and takes into account the GAAP required deferred revenue discount. Our revenue forecast for the fourth quarter 2020 implies a 12% to 14% growth rate compared to Q4 of last year.

We are forecasting fully diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to common stockholders to be in a range of a loss of $0.09 and a loss of $0.08 and fully diluted non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders before deemed dividends and acquisition-related expenses and excluding deferred tax benefits or expense to be in the range of $0.16 to $0.17 for the fourth quarter of 2020. We are currently forecasting adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 25% of forecasted revenue for Q4 2020. The per share guidance figures are based on an approximate basic share count of 55.3 million shares for Q4 2020. Based on our current visibility, we have increased our revenue range for the full fiscal year 2020.

We are currently forecasting revenue to range between $217 million and $218 million, representing an increase of between 25% and 26% compared to 2019. We also expect fully diluted GAAP loss per share attributable to common stockholders to range between a loss of $0.28 and a loss of $0.27 for the year. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders is expected to range between $0.60 and $0.61. Adjusted EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $51.2 million and $51.8 million or approximately 24% of total revenue for 2020 and a year-over-year increase of between 29% and 32% compared to fiscal year 2019.

The midpoint of this range is down $500,000 from prior guidance, mainly due to slightly higher variable count compensation due to higher revenue performance than the company had been forecasting for most of the year. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $51.2 to $51.8 million implies a leverage ratio of approximately 3.7 at the end of Q4, putting us comfortably below our maximum permitted leverage ratio of 4.75 for year-end 2020. The per share figures noted earlier are based on approximate basic share count of 54 million shares for 2020. Based on our current outlook, we expect to generate continued strong free cash flow in Q4 2020.

We are forecasting approximately $2.2 million in interest expense on our bank credit facility in Q4. Looking ahead into 2021, we also like to provide some early modeling information. First, the revenue related to the acquisition of CloudAlly will add approximately $1.5 million of revenue in Q1 2021. This takes into account the deferred revenue discount on CloudAlly's revenue, which will improve throughout the year as we build those customers and can recognize the full value of their ARR.

On the cost side, remember that the first quarter normally includes a slight decline in profitability and cash flow for the company as our first quarter includes increases in costs associated with payroll taxes, sales and marketing investments for the year and the timing of payments of our annual bonus program, as well as retention bonuses associated with our acquisitions. Also on the cost side, as I mentioned earlier, R&D expense will increase due to the amortization of capitalized software development costs on Secure Cloud and other Cloud-based development projects from 2020. These additional costs will impact 2021 EPS but will not impact EBITDA growth. This completes my financial summary.

And for a more detailed analysis of our financial results, please refer to today's earnings release as well as our 10-Q, which we filed today. Also visit our investor relations website to view our most recent investor presentation. Dave?

Dave Wagner -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Dave. I will now review our execution of strategy in the context of our three primary growth drivers, after which I will continue my discussion of why CloudAlly was the perfect acquisition for us and what it means for our business going forward. So starting with our first growth driver, which is new customer acquisition. We had some noteworthy wins in the quarter on both the Zix and AppRiver sides of the business.

First, on the Direct bar side, our top five wins in the quarter were in our traditional industries, including two in healthcare, two in finance and one in government. All five wins included email encryption and all five wins involve displacing a competitive solution. Our largest new customer win in Q3 was a six-figure deal in the finance vertical. This customer selected Zix, stating that they determined us to be best of breed compared to our most notable competitors.

We averaged two products per new customer and our top five new customer wins in the quarter and 88% of all new logo wins in the quarter were deployed on Secure Cloud. On the MSP partner side, we added 54 net new transacting partners in Q3, which compares to the 60 we added in Q2, bringing our total to 4507 at the end of the quarter. In Q3, we added approximately 170 net new customers per week, bringing our total customer count on the AppRiver side of the business to more than 75,000. Our sales momentum on both the direct and indirect side of our business picked up from Q2 levels into Q3 and continued into the current quarter as well.

As we shared on our last call, we achieved more than 4300 trials. Our second highest monthly total in July just behind June. Total October trials were just short of July levels. Zix IP trials for Q3 accounted for 27% of the total trials in the quarter, and we achieved a new record for IP trials in October.

In terms of our second growth driver, which is sales to existing customers. In Q3, our top five add-ons through our VAR and direct sales team included two in healthcare, one in banking, one in education and one in construction. We also had a broad mix of solutions represented in the top five, including two in encryption and two Office 365 add-ons. On the MSP side, sales to existing customers accounted for 47% of the monthly recurring revenue or MRR increases in the quarter, which compares to 22% in the prior quarter and 41% in Q3 of last year.

Moving on to our third growth driver, increasing retention. Our top five renewing customers by ARR in Q3 were all Cloud customers and 50% of our total renewing customers in the quarter were in the healthcare space. We also had a strong government renewal quarter that included renewals from six long-standing government customers, including one that first became a customer in 2002. As Dave mentioned, our total company net dollar retention was 99% in Q3, which was up from 96% in Q2 and just shy of our historical 100% plus level.

It's worth pointing out that our net dollar retention was impacted slightly in the quarter due to a $300,000 decline related to the planned end-of-life of our ZixOne product. Absent this change, we would have been at the 100% level. We have approximately $650,000 of ARR remaining from this product, which is scheduled to taper off through next year. Since the end of the quarter, we've seen our net dollar retention remain near the 100% threshold.

Today, Secure Cloud is a leading solution, enabling partners and end customers to achieve a secure modern workplace. Secure Cloud provides small and mid-market enterprises with unparalleled productivity, security and compliance; all from a single platform. The increase of remote work is making uninterrupted access to an organization's Cloud data vital for employee productivity. Remote work is also creating larger tax services, enabling more attacks, bigger breaches and a greater need for data restoration following a breach; which brings me to the strategic nature of the CloudAlly acquisition we announced earlier today.

I would like to take a few minutes to share with you why I am so excited to add CloudAlly and Cloud backup and recovery to our solution set and ultimately aim to Secure Cloud. There are three main reasons I really like this acquisition. Number one, it fills the number one partner request of what they want to buy next from Zix AppRiver. Number two, Cloud backup is an exciting and fast-growing market, which is highly complementary and is a natural extension of our current solutions.

And number three, in CloudAlly, we have added an extraordinary team of talented, Cloud-first, partner first, technology developers and professionals who share our vision of building superior products that are highly effective, easy to use and deploy and backed by phenomenal customer service. Over the summer, we did a comprehensive survey of our partner community. Of the 229 respondents, 59% had a current incumbent Office 365 backup vendor and 41% have yet to select a backup provider for their customers. Of the respondents, 55% indicated that they would be likely to resell Cloud backup from Zix.

And 34% said that they were 80% or more likely to resell Office 365 backup from Zix within two years. As you can see from the survey data, we expect to create a lot of shareholder value from Cloud backup as we work to double our Cloud backup ARR over the next three years. Beyond Office 365, and perhaps even more exciting, is our entry into the Cloud backup space more generally. The total backup market is estimated by Gartner to be $6.3 billion, growing at 2.5% annually.

Today, the Cloud backup segment represents about 20% of the total, or $1.3 billion; growing 25%, with Office 365 backup representing nearly half of that Cloud backup market at $600 million. We are focused on the large and growing Office 365 market, and we are excited that CloudAlly has solutions today for Google markets, Salesforce, Box and Dropbox. Each of these Cloud applications represent meaningful additional growth opportunities for Zix and our partners. When you step back and think about it, the rapid adoption of Cloud-based applications and the increasing value of the data sets in those applications, you can see a lot of room for future growth.

Which bridges me to my final point. We are really impressed with CloudAlly's born in the Cloud architecture. They've assembled a world-class technology team that has built products based on scalability, channel first, ease of use and data residency; all attributes that integrate very well with our strategy for Secure Cloud. Cloud backup and recovery is a critical component of a secure modern workplace.

And adding Cloud backup and recovery, will further improve our position with our partners as we work with them to capitalize on the digital transformation, our joint end customers require in our increasingly work from anywhere world. We are really excited to add the CloudAlly team to the Zix Corporate family. Speaking of new team members, I'm also pleased to announce our new Chief Product Officer, Ryan Allphin. As we think about our long-term growth, we see our Secure Cloud delivering value to partners and customers at the platform level, at the application level and through intelligence and data gathered from the vast amounts of information we will be processing.

Achieving this vision will require a product leader that can bring together product development and product management into a seamless organization with a shared technology strategy and product strategy. Ryan's most applicable experiences come from his 14 years at McAfee. At McAfee, Ryan held engineering leadership positions across a wide range of security products before progressing to become the General Manager of McAfee's Security Management Business Unit. Under Ryan's leadership, McAfee achieved the top Gartner Magic Quadrant rating for their endpoint security business.

He led several acquisition integrations, earned experienced building Cloud platforms and big data analytics projects. All experiences we expect to leverage as we continue to grow and scale our business at Zix. Digital transformation initiatives are continuing to proliferate, and we are well positioned to capitalize on a new work from anywhere world. With CloudAlly, Zix is even better positioned for profitable growth, higher attach rates and the opportunity to capture an even greater share of the multibillion-dollar business communications market.

That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're ready to open the call for questions.

Questions & Answers:

Operator

[Operator instructions.] Now our first question will come from Chad Bennett from Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.

Chad Bennett -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Nice job on the quarter, guys. So I was just hopping between calls and I looked at the M&A press release, and I didn't see an actual purchase price associated with CloudAlly.

Did you offer that up on the call?

Dave Rockvam -- Chief Financial Officer

No. It's approximately $30 million on the purchase price.

Chad Bennett -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

OK. And just, I guess, in terms of thinking about that business, guys, I mean the -- you're correct. The Cloud backup market is a very exciting market. And for sure, complementary to what you do.

And you indicated that based on your survey results, you believe some demand -- or significant demand is there just in the base. But I guess it's also just my experience there. It's a pretty competitive space. And I think you guys are somewhat used to that.

But just can you talk about the competitive landscape there real quick that at least you're familiar with today?

Dave Wagner -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So I think you're right. It is competitive. Of course, there are vendors who have been around a long time and have the good part of having the on-prem side of backup, which creates challenges on the Cloud backup.

So we're really, really pleased that we were very intentional about Cloud-to-Cloud backup. This is a pure, born in the Cloud, always in the Cloud backup platform. So we think that we're really, really well positioned, as we said in the press release, to handle Cloud-based workloads. That's where the growth is.

And we think by zeroing in on an asset that was focused on the Cloud backup, that's really going to help us out a lot. The second thing, if you remember, back to the strategy around the AppRiver acquisition just under two years ago, we recognize that the move to Cloud starts with Office 365 and grabbing those customers, the partners as they lead end customers from on-prem to the Cloud. That's the point at which that resiliency message, the importance of being secure and compliant. That's where that method resonates.

And so we think that we really are going to differentiate with where we sit in the partner ecosystem, as the productivity provider of choice is one of the largest CSP's in the country increasingly in the world. We think that's going to be a really nice competitive positioning as well. And then we love the idea of, as you pointed out, it's not just Office 365. Office 365 is about half the Cloud backup market today.

But these data sets in Salesforce in Box and Dropbox are increasingly getting high-value employee data in those workloads and being able to restore that data back to [court's] point in time. Makes an organization much more secure, much more productive, and we really think it's a great new customer and attach opportunity for us.

Chad Bennett -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Great. No, great color. And then maybe one follow-up for me. Just on Secure Cloud.

I mean the attach rates or kind of penetration rates continue to be very strong, even on the Zix core business are going up quite a bit sequentially. I guess when will we -- I know it's an interesting times and difficult environment. But when do we think that, that kind of moves the needle on net retention or net expansion, so to speak, because obviously, the product attach rates, you gave the metrics go up when you can get someone on Secure Cloud. Do you think we're close to being able to talk about, again, in a somewhat normalized environment, net retention kind of north of 100%?

Dave Wagner -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. That's certainly the goal. And we think we will get back there as the economy recovers as our attach opportunities improve, I did give the October number, which is just a very small hair under 100 at this point. So things have remained really strong and steady since June for us, and we do expect things to expand as the economy expands, hopefully, in next year.

Great. Nice job on the quarter guys.

Operator

[Operator instructions.] The next question is from Andrew King from Colliers Securities.

Andrew King -- Colliers Securities -- Analyst

So if you could just give us a little bit more color into the linearity of the quarter. And if you've seen any of the customers that originally took seats away from their deployment due to weighing staff offices onset of COVID. Have you seen any of them come back either start to add services back or add more seats as they start to add back personnel?

Dave Wagner -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. That's a great question. And we were really clear about that between Q2, I guess, in early Q3. And that's what we saw that brought us from 96% back to the over 99% in Q3, and those metrics, and that pace have stayed really, really steady through October.

So we're seeing a really steady, good environment, not like the environment we were in Q4 last year, but we see a real steady environment. Of course, that's on our monthly renewal customers. On the annual renewal customers, the COVID impacts we're still doing renewals on annual renewal customers who may have smaller workforces now than they did at their last renewal, and those will continue to work their way through the cycle between now and the March/April timeframe. That's a little less than 40% of our ARR.

So we feel that we're seeing the recovery in the monthly billing customers really consistently balanced by the annual renewal customers, who are still adjusting a little bit as we work them through the ARR renewal process.

Andrew King -- Colliers Securities -- Analyst

Great. And then just looking at the acquisition, can you give us an idea of the breakout of their revenues? How much of that's derived from Microsoft O365 versus other platforms and how that's broken out geography wise?

Dave Wagner -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes, they've done a really nice job, of course, getting into the Cloud backup market between really early and early and have done a nice job of covering the core applications. And Office 365 has been the lion's share of their backup market. They have nice customers and nice amounts of customers on each of those platforms I discussed, but I'd say it's almost 80% Office 365 in their partner customer base.

Dave Rockvam -- Chief Financial Officer

And then on a geography basis, they're not quite 50% U.S. and then over 50% rest of world. So they have a nice international component as well.

Operator

[Operator instructions.] Our next question is from Nehal Chokshi from Northland. Please proceed.

Nehal Chokshi -- Northcoast Securities Inc. -- Analyst

Yes. Thanks and congrats on a strong quarter, especially the free cash flow, well above our estimate. So for the December quarter, excluding the $1 million from CloudAlly, the midpoint revenue guidance is up 2% Q2, which is stronger than the guidance that you provided for September quarter of up 1% Q2. Dave Wagner, I think you've already alluded to this, but I just want to verify that.

Does this mean that you guys are seeing an improving environment? And if so, what are the indicators are giving you this incremental confidence relative to a quarter ago?

Dave Rockvam -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I'll also going to piggyback on Andrew's question about linearity, right? We talked about in -- on the July or the June quarter earnings call that we had a very strong record trials in June and a strong July, which was our second highest. So we were able to tell you on the call that we felt good about things, right, in 4Q, Q3, because of those trials, we saw that revenue come in or start to come in, in July, then having that strong July, made a good August. So we continued to see strength in the quarter, right? So when we see that -- saw that building, August would have been a little -- wouldn't have been as high as high of a month of trials because of vacations across Europe and the U.S., specifically.

But then September came back nicely, and that will change into revenue in October. So as far as the quarter goes, we saw good momentum and traction throughout Q3, which allowed us to a little bit stronger guidance and feel for Q4. And then adding on top, the $1 million from CloudAlly pushes us over-the-top end of what we said. So I think we were at $2.10 to $2.17 in April when we guided and brought that up just a little last quarter and then this quarter, with the results we saw in Q3, able to bring it up the rest of the way to get to the top end of that revenue range.

Nehal Chokshi -- Northcoast Securities Inc. -- Analyst

OK. Great. And then I want to drill a little bit more into these trials, especially the AppRiver customers that are trialing the Zix Security IP. What's the typical characteristics of the companies that are trialing the Zix Security IP that are already an approval customer?

Dave Wagner -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So the average customer size is right around 25 mailboxes. So these, on average, are smaller customers. Of course, the IP set, especially encryption archive, tend to work better at the larger end customer size.

So when you get into the Zix IP, they tend to be slightly larger. But we're still talking, Nehal, on the AppRiver platform averages in the 20% to 30% range and not larger customers. I mean, AppRiver does have some large customers. We have partners who work up into the thousands of users, but a lot of small businesses, over 75,000 small businesses, all over the country and increasingly in the U.K.

are that customer base that tend to be on the smaller side.

Nehal Chokshi -- Northcoast Securities Inc. -- Analyst

And these customers that are on the smaller side, did they already have an existing secure email gateway provider?

Dave Wagner -- Chief Executive Officer

So we're garnering end customers, lots of different ways. A lot of times, we recruit a new partner, the new partner, that will be a great opportunity for us to make sure that they're positioning additional security and compliance products as they come across. And so we collect customers there. We gather new customers from the exchange to Office 365 motion, and so we attach there as well.

The attach rates, we would like to be higher, so that we're still, as Dave said, we're in the 1.1 total, probably 1.2 in on the AppRiver Secure Cloud side. So we need those to grow higher, and we're getting them higher literally every month, but they're inching higher as opposed to racing higher, and I'm really happy with the trend and the trajectory, and we're staying on it, particularly being successful with the newer customers and the newer partners coming on to the ecosystem.

Nehal Chokshi -- Northcoast Securities Inc. -- Analyst

All right. Thank you.

Operator

At this time, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over back to Mr. Wagner for his closing remarks.

3 Key Takeaways from Electronic Arts' Q2 Earnings Report,Motley Fool,5 days ago,"Furthermore, the company expects growth to continue into fiscal 2022, as the Sony PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X/S are coming to market this ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/11/3-key-takeaways-from-electronic-arts-q2-earnings-r/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Video game producer Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) continues to benefit as people still have limited entertainment options. Many schools and colleges remain closed for in-person classes, so the younger generation that tends to play the company's games is spending more time near their game consoles and computer screens, which allows them to switch from a school task to engaging with a game almost instantaneously.

That continued positive performance showed up last week when the company reported fiscal 2021 second-quarter earnings. One big takeaway from the report is that management felt so good about the company's current and future prospects that it initiated a new share buyback program and it announced plans to initiate a dividend for the first time in the company's history (more on this below).

Let's take a closer look at three other key takeaways from the company's second-quarter earnings report.

People are spending more time and money on games

The first takeaway is that engagement with the company's games continues to surge even though economies globally were starting to reopen following coronavirus-related shutdowns during the quarter. Net bookings for the trailing 12 months (TTM) were up by 8% year over year to $5.6 billion. Still, coronavirus cases are again surging in several areas and even though people have the option of going out to more places than during the initial lockdowns, those consumers are cautious in doing so.

The second takeaway came from management's forecast regarding Q3. On Oct. 9, EA launched a new version of its most popular game franchise, FIFA 21. Although the results from the sales will be included in its third-quarter report, management gave an update on how the two games it has launched so far in the third quarter are faring:

We started our third quarter by launching 2 new EA SPORTS games. When it went live globally on October 9, FIFA 21 already had a record number of players in the game through the early access benefit of our subscription. Our player metrics in FIFA 21 are strong, and FIFA Ultimate Team also continues to grow with matches in the mode up 30% year-over-year. NHL 21, which includes the fan-favorite NHL 94 Rewind has quickly become the most successful NHL game yet on current-gen consoles.

The final takeaway is that surging revenue has lead to a windfall in cash flow, and the company has decided to return some of that to shareholders. Electronic Arts announced a two-year, $2.6 billion stock buyback program. Additionally, the company will now start paying a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share.

Looking ahead

Interestingly, the company did not change its revenue and earnings per share forecast for its fiscal year 2021 -- reiterating that it expects to bring in $5.63 billion in revenue and EPS of $3.15. Furthermore, the company expects growth to continue into fiscal 2022, as the Sony PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X/S are coming to market this month.

The next-gen gaming consoles come at an opportune time for this consumer discretionary stock, as consumers are still spending tremendous amounts of time at home. Even though there have been positive developments for a coronavirus vaccine, it could still take six months to a year for large groups of the population to get vaccinated, once a vaccine is fully approved.

All the while, options for entertainment outside of people's homes might remain limited, thereby giving Electronic Arts more time to connect with gamers. And when the pandemic has run its course, the company will still generate interest from gamers because of its proven ability to create new and exciting titles. Things are looking good for Electronic Arts, and investors should consider adding it to their list of stocks to watch.",microsoft,msft,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.852, 'pos': 0.148, 'compound': 0.3818}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.852, 'pos': 0.148, 'compound': 0.3818}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.1909,0.0,0.1909,0.12726666666666667,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Positive,Neutral,Somewhat Positive
